      a turning point in the late 1960s/early 1970s. This
      transition saw shifts in relationships between Puget Sound
      residents and the military, from a traditional, almost
      unanimous support for the military's presence in the
      region, to the development of a much more hostile attitude
      among some segments of the public. This change reflected
      growing concerns about the environment and skepticism about
      military-related economic growth. It was also shaped by
      concerns about nuclear weapons and the role of the armed
      services in {U.S.} foreign relations, the result of the
      rebirth of the anti-nuclear movement across the United
