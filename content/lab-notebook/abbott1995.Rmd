## Introduction

"the nation's most open and empty region is also its most heavily urbanized." (xi)

Making two arguments:

1. Western cities organize the region's vast spaces and connect them to the
   world economy
2. urban growth since 1940 is a distinct era where Western cities have become
   national and international pacesetters. (xii)

> By 1990, 80 percent of Westerners lived in metropolitan areas ranging in
> size from Enid, Oklahoma (with 60,000 people), Casper, Wyoming (66,000), and
> Grand Forks, North Dakota (71,000), to the Los-Angeles-Anaheim-Riverside
> complex, with its 14,532,000 people. Roughly half of the rest lived in
> smaller towns and cities of 2,500 or more, leaving only one Westerner in ten
> for the "real West" of farms, ranches, lonely desert gas stations, and
> railroad hamlets clustered around the gray columns of grain elevators. (p.
> xii)

Urbanization is "a dual process" (p xii-xiii)

1. involves "the creation of new points of population concentration"
2. and the "growth of existing points"

Between 1815 and 1930, urbanization transformed the US from "a collection of
rural societies to a metropolitan nation." The process has most clearly and
completely occurred in the West. (xiii)

The West has seen metropolitan growth faster than the nation on a whole. The
half dozen largest metropolitan areas in the West in 1940 grew by 380 percent
over fifty years, compared to the six largest in the East that grew only 64
percent. (xiii)

Western cities hold "a special relationship with wide open spaces." Industries
in "defense, aerospace, and leisure have flourished in the wEst because of the
elbow room available in the region's metropolitan areas." (xiii)

"Cities have made the American West a major participant in the ongoing
restructuring of the world system." (xv)

"World War II changed the growth curve for every Western subregion, reversing
decline or stagnation in much of the West and accelerating growth in a few
favored areas. The war and its aftermath mark the takeoff when Western cities
as a group changed from followers to trendsetters." (xviii)

> The total metropolitan population in the Western states surged from 11.8
> million in 1940 to 28.7 million in 1960, 50.9 million in 1980, and 63
> million in 1990. Los Angeles-Anaheim formed the nation's second largest
> urban complex by 1980, the Bay Area conurbation ranked fourth, Dallas-Fort
> Worth ninth, and Houston-Galveston tenth. During the 1980s, nineteen of the
> nation's thirty-nine biggest metro areas (with populations of a million or
> more) grew faster than the country as a whole (11 percent or more for the
> decade). Twelve of these boom cities were located in the West, with an
> aggregate population increase of 8.4 million residents for the decade. One
> out of every four Americans now lives in a Western metropolitan area, up
> from one out of eleven in 1940 (xviii-xix)

Population growth in the West has been a long cycle of economic growth
concentrated in the Southwest and Far West. Economic development began in
1930, surged through the 1940s and 1950s, crested in the 1970s and receded
somewhat in the 1980s. Abbott uses the idea of "long waves or fifty-year
cycles in the global economy" (see Chapter 1) to discuss the periods of
"creative destruction" where "new industries shoulder aside older industries
and open opportunities for new regions to come to the fore." (xix). The
long-wave theory, Abbott argues, "describes the context within which Western
cities have experienced and responded to the conflicting demands of the
continental resource frontier and global networks." (xxi).

Western cities became pacesetters, they "have defined new directions for
American economic growth that we have tried to capture with coinages like
'Silicon Valley' and 'Sunbelt.'" (xxi)

Abbott describes his central goal in the book is to "recognize and describe
common patterns in Western urban development and to stimulate further
investigation of suggested regularities and patterns." (xxii) In the second
half of the twentieth century, Abbott maintains that "Western cities have most
often expressed the American democratic tradition of open communities designed
to accommodate new industries, new immigrants, and new ideas." (xxiii)

## Chapter 2: The Politics of Growth

Noting the formation of the Progress Committee in 1944 San Jose, which wanted
to build "a new metropolis in the place of sleepy San Jose." (quoted; 39).
Standing up to labor unions and large landowners, the Progress Committee swept
into the city council. The Council was heavily focused on business and
comprised mostly of merchants, lawyers, and industrialists. The Committee
disappeared as a formal organization soon after its 1944 victory but its
business agenda continued to dominate San Jose politics. Under the leadership
of city manager [Dutch Hamann]() who was hired in 1950 with the goal to make
San Jose "the Los Angeles of the North," the city embarked on recruiting
industry, building new streets, sewers, and an airport. The city grew quickly,
from 11 square miles in 1940 to 137 square miles in 1970, and extended
"shoestring" annexations along highways "to reach attractive outlying
districts." Just as Los Angeles had used its water supply to force
annexations, San Jose used its sewer system as the price of annexation. City
officials justifed expansion on the basis of efficiency --- a larger tax base
for public service, coordinating capital improvements, and acquiring necessary
land for parks and facilities. (pp. 39-40).

Cites [trounstine1982movers]() in noting that San Jose boosters sought to
maintain a separate identity, resisting inclusion with the San
Francisco-Oakland metropolitan area in 1950 and rejecting their participation
in [Bay Area Rapid Transit]() in 1957. The main beneficiaries, however, were
real estate developers and the *San Jose Mercury*. Under the leadership of
[Joe Ridder](), the newspaper became a booster for growth and grew wealthy
with advertising revenue. Ridder claimed that he and the newspaper were being
"a constructive force in the development of San Jose and its territory."
(quoted; 40)

## Chapter 3: From Regional Cities to National Cities

p. 61: "During the 1970s, Arizona, California, Washington, Kansas, Utah, and
Colorado ranked among the top ten states for high-tech jobs as a proportion of
total employment. All six states also made the list of defense-dependent
states in the 1950s."

Santa Clara was the setting for a defense-science-industry alliance
emphasizing electronics and aerospace. (61)

When Frederick Terman returned to Stanford after World War II, he was
determined to build industry-university alliances in basic research. Stanford
was a perfect site for these changes, being cash poor but land rich and
determined to become an educational elite. (61)

The founding of the Stanford research park in 1951 began the move into the
computer economy:

> Stanford Industrial Park began to fulfill its promise in the mid-1950s,
> attracting a new company started by two of Terman's students, William Hewitt
> and David Packard, as well as research and development facilities for Xerox
> and Lockheed. ITT, IBM, Sylvania, Admiral, and similar companies established
> research facilities elsewhere in the county. The other key event was William
> Shockley's 1955 move from Bell Labs in New Jersey to Palo Alto to develop
> commercial applications of the transistor, which he had invented with John
> Bardeen and Walter Brattain. Within a year, a group of his own employees had
> moved to establish Fairchild Semiconductor in Mountain View, the county's
> first major semiconductor company. Easy access to San Francisco's
> venture-capital market facilitated electronics start-ups. Fairchild itself
> would spin off fifty other firms by 1979. (p. 62)

By the mid-1960s, the military markets in Silicon Valley were supplemented by
civilian markets. The Valley cut a ten-by-thirty mile swathe through Santa
Clara County. In 1950, Santa Clara County had 800 manufacturing workers,
primarily employed in food processing. In 1980, it had roughly 3,000
electronics firms, 264,000 manufacturing workers, and annual sales of $40
billion. Executives and engineers built their homes to the north and in the
foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains, while skilled workers with Filipino,
Vietnamese, and Mexican backgrounds moved to San Jose. (p 62)

Several "silicon clones" sprang up around the West after the success of
Silicon Valley. HP and Ampex both opened plants in Colorado Springs in the
late 1960s, and by the mid-1980s the "Silicon Mountain" was creating
semiconductors, aerospace systems, and communications equipment. Similar
spinoffs in the "Silicon Prairie" and "Silicon Desert" -- Austin, for example,
mimicked Stanford's Industrial Park when it converted a magnesium plant from
World War II into the Balcones Research Center to focus on defense work. In
1966 IBM became the first large electronics corporation to move into the city,
followed by Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Motorola, and other companies
moved in over the next fifteen years. Likewise, Phoenix benefited from
Motorola's 1948 decision to open a facility focusing on defense electronics, which paved
the way for Sperry Rand, General Electric, AirResearch, and Kaiser
Aircraft and Electronics. In the 1970s, Honeywell, IBM, DEC, Intel, and
National Semiconductor established corporate facilities in Phoenix. Portland
and Dallas incubated Tektronics and Texas Instruments in the 1970s. (p. 64)

## Chapter 5: The Politics of Diversity

Looking at the "rise of neighborhood liberals" in cities like Austin and
Portland, which came with the increasing importance of women in politics.
Between 1970 and 1990, places like Dallas, Oklahoma City, Austin, Portland,
Fort Worth, Austin, Houston, Galveston, San Antonio, Corpus Cristi, El Paso,
Phoenix, Santa Barbara, San Jose, San Francisco, Modesto, Stockton, and
Spokane saw a rise in women politicians. In 1987, women served as mayor in
twenty-six Western cities of at least 50,000 residents. (111)

Abbott argues the rise of new leadership reflected "the same institutional
openness that assisted neoprogressive reform after World War II." The
political empowerment comes from "the special character of Western cities"

  * "The cities of the postwar West were communities filled with newcomers
  who lacked ties and oblications to extended families, churches, and other
  community institutions." (111)
  * "The spreading suburbs of Western cities were 'frontiers' that required
  concerted action to solve immediate functional and service needs, like
  adequate schools and decent parks." Since these were often viewed as
  "woman's work" suburbs "offered numerous opportunities for women to engage
  in volunteer civic work, to sharpen their skills as political activists, and
  finally to run for local office." (111)
  * "Western cities had fewer established political institutions such as
  political machines and strong parties. In the same way that it helped the
  neoprogressives, a system of personal, nonparty politics was open to the
  influence of energetic women." (111)

He points to San Jose and Santa Clara County as a "specific impact" in what
some call the "feminist capital of the nation." In 1980 voters made women a
three-to-one majority on the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors and a
seven-to-four majority on the San Jose City Council. Notes that [Janet Gray
Hayes](), elected in 1974 under the slogan "Let's make San Jose better before we
make it bigger."

## "Quality-of-Life" Politics

Abbott points to his previous *The New Urban America* (1981), in which he
noted the mobilization of activists he called "quality-of-life liberals." This
liberalism manifested itself through the growth of the environmental movement,
and often were middle-class city people "worried that breakneck development
was fouling the air, eating up open space, sacrificing neighborhoods to the
automobile, and deferring the huge costs of remediation to future decades."
(103) The agenda included "environmental clean-up, the promotion of public
transportation, and the renewal rather than abandonment of older
neighborhoods." (103)

p. 103: "Neighborhood liberals sometimes found that the neoprogressive
coalitions of the 1950s had already been weakened by the rise of new suburban
industries whose owners and managers thought very little about the needs of
central-city businesses. New aerospace, defense, and electronics companies
cared far more about suburban highways and world markets than about fading
downtowns, older neighborhoods, and public transportation."

Cites [trounstine1982movers](): "downtown San Jose has simply not been a
serious concern for the major corporate interests who have built their
low-rise headquarters in Silicon Valley cities to the north." (quoted; 103)

Some historians take issue with the reasoning that quality-of-life politics
was decidedly liberal. See [childers2012ski](), [scott2008hipcapitalism]().
