I am interested in the relationships among people and institutions. I am looking
at using network analysis to examine the social connections between activists,
business leaders, politicians, and institutions such as universities,
environmental  organizations, and community organizations. How these might play
out I am unsure of, but the visualization might show interesting connections
between people in the community that suggests something about how people and
organizations worked together. 

Some of this is being tracked already in the Master Google Spreadsheet.
