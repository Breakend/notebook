My name is [Jason Heppler](http://jasonheppler.org), I am the Digital Engagement Librarian and Assistant Professor of History at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. This is my [open research notebook](/lab-notebook/) which contains notes of my ongoing projects. You can follow [my Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/hepplerj/items) for recent items, and I also maintain [GitHub repositories](http://github.com/hepplerj) for other work related to my research and scholarship.

My **current main project** is a book on environmental politics in Silicon Valley. The work explores the postwar growth of the suburbs of Silicon Valley and the ways that their growth not only led to ecological disaster but introduced social inequality that fueled an environmental politic that redefined liberal and conservative politics. 

You can explore the notebook by following the links on the right, or selecting the Notebook above.
