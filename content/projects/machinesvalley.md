>  This page is a running log of my thoughts on my dissertation and eventual book manuscript. Ideas here might be convoluted and change frequently as my research direction changes. Interpretations here are provisional and dependent on research in progress.

Dissertations are funny things. When I first proposed my dissertation topic in the winter of 2012, I was focused on the origins of the Internet as a physical place: the four western universities that made up the original nodes of the Internet. I was curious about exploring how these places came to be the origins of ARPANET and whether there was something about their history as major urban centers that led to them becoming a core site in network research. After I moved to Silicon Valley, immediately after defending my dissertation proposal, I came to another realization: that no history of Silicon Valley had considered the environmental impact of high tech suburbs. I was curious about the link between the West's high-tech suburbs and the environmental cost of their presence: water, energy, land. And thus, my dissertation's topic shifted.

I feel as though my dissertation is now entering its third life as it starts its transformation from dissertation to book. Broadly, I am tracing the emergence environmental politics in Silicon Valley between 1945 and 1990. Activists, residents, politicians, and business owners all sought to shape the political structure of the changing urban environment, and this highlights contests over space and who contested power over space at a moment in time when the postindustrial economy was exerting enormous change upon metropolitan regions.

## Urban Environmentalism in Silicon Valley

I started with a seemingly simple question: Does nature matter to Silicon Valley?

The story I plan to tell plays out in many metropolitan areas across the
United States. Many urban areas in the American West in particular
underwent dramatic economic development in the wake of the computer
economy's appearance in metropolitan regions. Santa Clara County,
California, had 800 factory workers in 1950. By 1980, it had 264,000
manufacturing workers and three thousand electronics firms. By the 1980s
the West had become the center of atomic research, aerospace
manufacturing, and industries specializing in military control systems.
The information and electronics industries established roots in Dallas,
Portland, Phoenix, Denver, Salt Lake City, Boise, and Austin. Arizona,
for example, was profoundly affected by the new high tech industries
that were making the West their home. Electronics giant Motorola built a
plant in the late 1940s, attracted to the right-to-work laws,
pro-business attitude, and favorable tax climate. Within two decades,
electronics-aerospace firms such as Hughes Aircraft, General Electric,
and Honeywell moved in as well. Arizona shifted its traditional reliance
on the 3C's -- copper, cotton, and cattle -- to become a key locale in
the corporate West.[^3] By the 1980s, 40 percent of Arizona's economy was
based on high tech industries and the state's population ballooned to
3.1 million, a fourfold growth since 1945.[^4]

The urban West also attracted high levels of investment by the
military-industrial-academic complex through aerospace, computer, and academic
contracts. In 1967, James Clayton identified western states as being heavily
dependent on defense spending, concluding that "it is entirely possible that
defense spending will loom as the single most important economic and
demographic factor in the history of the West during the past two
decades."[^5] Clayton's generalities were largely correct by the 1970s.
California had 24% of the prime military contracts in the country in 1959. In
1962, the Pacific Coast had 46% of all Defense Department contracts for
research and development. The interior states of the West also increased their
ties to the growing military-industrial complex, and these industries
attracted a better-educated workforce and urban populace. Urban westerners
were better educated than Americans overall: almost 46% of adults in the
metropolitan regions of the West were high school graduates in 1950, compared
to 34.3% in the rest of the nation. As the national average rose over the
next two decades the West maintained its 10% edge. In 1960, Albuquerque, New
Mexico, boasted more Ph.D. degrees per capita than any other American
city.[^6] Six of the ten metropolitan areas with the highest number of
civilian Department of Defense employees were western -- San Antonio, Salt
Lake City, San Diego, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Honolulu. Half of
metropolitan areas in the West received more in federal defense spending than
they paid in tax contributions for defense.[^7]

The focus on Silicon Valley helps illuminate the growing influence of
environmental politics in the United States. Throughout the postwar decades,
everyday residents of metropolitan regions began asking questions about their
environment, enough concerned about environmental change that local activists
movements emerged to challenge municipalities in unrestricted urban growth and
environmental degradation. I focus on a single locality and use a micro view of
western cities to understand how people created, influenced, or were affected by
urban change and culture. As Carl Abbott once reminded urban historians, "case
studies are the imperfect equivalents of experiments through which we test and
refine large-scale generalizations and theory."[^1] The area under study is not
comprehensive of metropolitan change, but investigates the engagement between
economic development, urban growth, postindustrial change, and environmental
politics. The importance of local politics means an intensive examination of the
experiences in the metropolitan region and illustrates broader patterns of
environmental activism throughout the United States.

In addition to environmental politics and political culture, the project uses *place and landscape* as a central point for analysis. Henri Lefebvre has noted that social relations are cultural and spatial constructions.[^2] So too are environmental relations entirely defined by individual relationships to space and culture. As Robert Self notes, people and communities do "not compete for resources for abstract goals and purposes. They competed to put those resources to use to create particular and concrete places.  . . . [People] called for very specific things in relation to very specific places."[^8] The environmental politics of Silicon Valley were tied to spatial politics. 

### Suburban Environmentalism

My work engages with the suburban origins of environmentalism identified by previous scholars, among them [rome2001bulldozer](/rome2001bulldozer/), [sellers2012crucible](/sellers2012crucible/), [mozingo2011pastoral](/mozingo2011pastoral/), and [klingle2007emerald](/klingle2007emerald/). Much of the criticism leveled against industrial and urban growth by suburbanites was couched in the language of the countryside and idealism of country living.

Yet the research also intersects with the histories of postwar liberalism and conservatism. Rather than bastions of conservative political thought narrated by [mcgirr2006warriors](/mcgirr2006warriors/) and others, I see the suburbs in Silicon Valley as harbingers of a suburban liberalism. Suburbanites of the Valley maintained a belief in the role of government, quality-of-life, civil rights, and environmental quality in their communities, thus complicating how not only politics worked in American suburbs but also how the origins of environmentalism finds itself in both liberal and conservative politics.

### Urban Sustainability

My work also intersects, to a degree, on the emerging historiography on sustainability. The works here are a bit fewer, and I'm leaning mostly on [sanders2010sustainability](/sanders2010sustainability/). But I'm also continuing to think through how the environmental movement intersects with the sustainability movement. In a place like Silicon Valley, where environmentalists I look into are getting their start on issues as varied as adquate housing and traffic congestion. 

### History of Capitalism

Still thinking through this and I'll fill this out more as I confront the issues further. Some initial notes are in [20141112 - Suburbs and Nature#potential-directions](/2016-02-01-nature-and-suburbs/#potential-directions).

### GIS

I've moved my log of thoughts about using GIS to my [GIS log](/gis-log/).

### Network analysis

I am keeping a [Network Log](/network-log/) to track my work as I go along.
