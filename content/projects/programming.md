This page houses programming resources I found useful when working on a project. It is likely going to be disorganized. 

## Common Lisp

- Use [roswell](https://github.com/roswell/roswell) for building command line tools
- [lake](https://github.com/takagi/lake) is a make alternative

## Python

- [The Definitive Guide to Python import Statements](https://chrisyeh96.github.io/2017/08/08/definitive-guide-python-imports.html) is a good guide for the import mess in Python
- [pydash](https://github.com/dgilland/pydash) has some nice high level functions
- use [glom](https://github.com/mahmoud/glom) for working with nested data
- use [conda](https://conda.io/) for a data science setup and managing your environment

## Tools

- [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) for document conversions
- [imagemagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) for image manipulation
- [gifsicle](https://github.com/kohler/gifsicle) for working with gifs
- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) for media conversion
- [q](https://harelba.github.io/q/) allows for running SQL over CSVs
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) for working with json strings in the command line
- [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) is easier than `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
