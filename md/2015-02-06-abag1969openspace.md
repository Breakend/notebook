The Goals and Organization ("GO") Committee of ABAG reported to the
general assembly:

> The continuing pressures of rapid population growth and urbanization
> require immediate attention to the needs for recreation and open space
> facilities which, because of their size, cost and nature, cannot be
> provided by individual cities, counties and existing districts, and
> which are not being adequately met by existing Federal or State
> programs.

- **Stressing here the need for local action, but the hyperlocal is
  inadequate -- arguing for a regional approach**

Citing the POS 1968 "Case for Open Space" study.

ABAG outlines the purposes for open space planning at the regional level
as:

1. "Provide a regional link between State and local open space
   planning." (10)
2. "Stimulate local planning agencies to extend the open space concept to
   smaller planning units in such a manner as to integrate the concept
   with that of the region." (10)
3. "Provide a basis for regional cooperation in open space preservation to
   include not only government, but also semi-public (such as utility
   companies) and voluntary agencies, business and industry, citizen
   groups and individuals." (10)
4. "Stimulate open space research." (11)
5. "Contribute to an awareness of the importance of open space to the
   region." (11)

p. 25: "By the year 1990 the regional population should almost double;
the general recreation demand should triple; but the demands for
recreation opportunities 'a half-hour from home' should increase
tenfold. This will be due to the compound effects of living in and
around cities, with more leisure, higher incomes and greater interest in
outdoor recreation activities."

p. 27: Defining recreation based on a 1965 national survey of outdoor
recreation participation: "bicycling, playing outdoor games or sports,
birdwatching, walking and driving for pleasure, swimming, etc. were
still the main activities in terms of days of participation during
summer outings. Some activities requiring more skill, greater travel and
substantial investment in recreational equipment, i.e., waterskiing,
skiing, sailing, made substantial gains although days of participation
in these activities were still substantially below the simpler, less
expensive forms of outdoor recreation."
