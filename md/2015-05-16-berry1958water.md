p. 679: Expansion of water resources in the Bay Area, as population, industry, and irrigated agriculture expand, "must be accompanied by its appropriate amount of imported water."

p. 679: The South Bay has a population around 2,300,000 in 1950, and around 150,000 acres of irrigated land.

p. 279: Notes the problem of water pumping being excessively pumped and drawing water from under the Bay. "Continuation of this practice could prove to be disastrous if it were to bring salt water into the aquifer. The ground water basins in San Mateo County are being used to their full potential."

p. 279: "In addition to the water developed from local sources, three aqueduct systems bring water to the south bay area from the Central Valley of California: the Contra Costa Canal, the Mokelumne River Aqueduct, and the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct. These works are presently capable of conveying over 550,000 acre-ft of water per year into the bay area and are importing currently approximately 300,000 acre-ft annually."

p. 683: "The South Bay Aqueduct, a feature of the state-authorized Feather River Project, would divert water from the Feater River Project Aqueduct on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley. The latter aqueduct, in turn, would receive its supply form the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta to the north, the supply consisting of present flows in the delta, firmed by operation of Oroville Reservoir on the Feather River in the Sacramento Valley."
