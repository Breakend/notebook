Harold Gilliam graduated from the University of California-Berkeley and wrote for the *San Francisco Chronicle* and *Examiner* newspapers. His 1979 article "The Destruction of Mono Lake Is on Schedule" in *Examiner* was among the first to draw attention to Mono Lake. Most of his work centers around San Francisco and the Bay Area.
