## Chapter 1

Professors "who try doing writing in brief, daily sessions during busy weeks evidence two benefits" (p. 14)

1. "they typically produce far more writing than do colleagues who work in
   binges" (14)
2. "they find writing more enjoyable--in part because it no longer requires
   substantial warm-up times and in part because they no longer need to take it
   home to complete it." (14)

## Chapter 2

Mostly about the psychological barriers to writing: some writers have difficulty starting, but then keep going; others have difficulty finishing. Helpful to suggest that people must re-test their beliefs about writing.

## Chapter 3

Suggests keeping track of writing output, including note taking.

> In my experience, problem writers usually dislike prewriting, perhaps because
> writing problems and impatience are so often interrelated. (p. 34)

Three modalities of writing problems (p. 37):

1.  overt signs (e.g., putting off writing as long as possible)
2.  cognitions and emotions (e.g., "I feel nervous about starting")
3.  social skills (e.g., "my friends take an active interest in my writing")

Components of writing problems (p. 38):

1.  work apprehension (e.g., "I don't feel like doing this")
2.  procrastination (e.g., "I work best when I wait until the last minute")
3.  writing apprehension (e.g., "I just don't match up to what others can do")
4.  dysphoria (e.g., "I'm too depressed to write")
5.  impatience (e.g., "I'm not working fast enough")
6.  perfectionism (e.g., "What if someone finds a mistake in my paper?")
7.  rules (e.g., "I hate to outline")

## Chapter 4

> writing often proceeds most smoothly and fluently when writers work without
> conscious reflection of what they're writing. (41)

Dorothea Brande recommends waking up a half hour or hour earlier than usual and just writing. Boice recommends 10 minutes of spontaneous writing. Permit cheating: copy a book if that helps get you started writing. You should share your writing with someone else. Boice suggests keeping up with spontaneous writing for one week (two at most) before moving on to the next chapter. (45--47)
