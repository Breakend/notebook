Gilliam's wide-ranging book covers a variety of environmental issues in California ranging from water issues to urban growth. The chapters are short snippets on issues and opinions.

p. 2:

> The San Francisco Bay Area has become a vortex of the ecology movement for
> two reasons---its turbulent history, which resembles that of no other
> American city, and its superlative natural environment, which has given it
> a great deal to fight for. The American movement to preserve the natural
> environment can be dated from the founding of the Sierra Club here in 1892 by
> John Muir and his colleagues. A comparable event occurred in 1969 when Ray
> Balter and his colleagues opened the first Ecology Center in an old store on
> Oxford street in Berkeley, leading to the creation of more than 100 such
> centers throughout the nation.
