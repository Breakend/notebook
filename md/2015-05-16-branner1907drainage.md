p. 2: "necessary to imagine the Golden Gate closed and the Sacramento Valley drainage flowing down the Santa Clara Valley and emptying into the Bay of Monterey"

p. 3: "From the mouth of the gorge where this creek debouches on the plain a great alluvial fan spreads out toward the south and west across the entire width of the Santa Clara Valley, at this place a distance of two and a half miles. This fan forms the watershed in the valley trough between the Bay of San Francisco and the Pajaro River"

p. 7: "the coast must have stood much higher when those valleys were cut than it does at present."

p. 7: The Bay and its submerged valleys were "formed when the region was out of water"

p. 8: "streams which are now clearly separated were formerly connected"

p. 8: "apparently made possible by an elevation of the coast which permitted two or three streams to enter the ocean by a single mouth"
