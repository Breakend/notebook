p. 2: "help explain contemporary landscape patterns, which are often shaped by prior human impacts that have been forgotten or overlooked"

p. 2: "California's rangelands were historically more diverse (with varying dominance by rhizomatous grasses and other range types)."

p. 2: "reconstruct the historical extent of wetlands and woodlands along Coyote Creek, on the east side of Santa Clara Valley, California (known internationally as "Silicon Valley")"

p. 3: "Perennial, non-tidal valley floor freshwater marsh provides habitat for several protected native species, including the California red-legged frog (*Rana aurora draytonii*), Western pond turtle (*Actinemys marmorata pallida*), and tri-colored blackbird (*Agelaius tricolor*)"

p. 3: "Riparian plant communities are considered to have high value for native wildlife species (NRC 2002; RHJV 2004) and are of particular conservation interest in the Santa Clara Valley."

p. 3: "most of Coyote Creek's mainstem is densely forested and assumed to be a remnant of historical conditions"

p. 3: "sycamore alluvial woodland, a relatively rare land cover type"

p. 3: "As a result of this new interest, a number of large- scale restoration and conservation planning efforts are currently underway in the Coyote Creek watershed, including the South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project, the Santa Clara Valley Water District's (SCVWD) Natural Flood Protection Pro- gram, the Fisheries and Aquatic Habitat Collaborative Effort, and the Santa Clara Valley Habitat Conservation Plan/Natural Community Conservation Plan (HCP/NCCP)."

p. 3: "Valley oak (*Quercus lobata*) is recognized as one of California's most threatened oaks, largely because of its association with fertile valleys subject to agricultural and urban/suburban development"

p. 3: "freshwater marsh, riparian communities, and valley oak savanna"

p. 4: Coyote Dam (1939) and Anderson Dam (1950) now regulate over 75% of watershed discharge.

p. 4: "The creek follows a northwesterly route across the east side of the valley before meeting the southern end of San Francisco Bay"

p. 4: "Coyote Creek watershed is the largest in the Santa Clara Basin, covering about 90,000 ha"

p. 4: "The region is characterized by a mild Mediterranean type, semi-arid climate. It receives 250--500 mm annual precipitation, of which 90% occurs during November through April"

p. 4: "very gently sloped alluvial plain of Late Quaternary origin"

p. 6: "Valley freshwater marsh, wet meadow, alkali meadow, willow grove, and valley oak savanna"

p. 9: "Seasonally-flooded wet meadows covered an estimated 2,400 ha prior to Euro--American modification (22% of the study area)"

p 9: "10 valley freshwater marshes that could be confidently described (high or medium interpretation certainty) as preceding Euro--American influence."

p. 9: "Seasonally flooded alkali meadows were also a significant land cover component, comprising an estimated 1,637 ha, or 15% of the mapped area"

p. 11: "Forested wetland areas dominated by willows represented a relatively small percentage of land cover prior to Euro--American modification (2%, or 165 ha),"

p. 11: "riparian cover along Coyote Creek, but were not sufficiently detailed to delineate these classes individually"

p. 12: "valley oak savanna, it was clearly a major land cover type, with an estimated total area of 6,158 ha"

p. 12: "hanges in stream hydrology, including flood control and summer water release for groundwater recharge associated with the installation of Coyote Dam in 1936 and Anderson Reservoir in 1950"

p. 12: "Prior to Euro--American modification, the eastern Santa Clara Valley supported a heterogeneous native land cover. Mosaics of valley oaks and grassland occupied the more well-drained alluvial fans and natural stream levees of Coyote Creek"

p. 12: "lesser nighthawk (*Chordeiles acutipennis*) commonly nested in the unvegetated gravelly channel beds in the 1930s (Pickwell and Smith 1938) but is no longer a breeding resident, likely due to the change in riparian character and loss of gravel bars resulting from water management"

p. 12: "the most productive agricultural lands (primarily fruit orchards) and experienced rapid urban expansion in the second half of the 20th century"

p. 12: "clay soils were characterized by wetland habitats"
