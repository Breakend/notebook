> Stuart L. Deutch, "Land Use Growth Controls: A Case Study of San Jose
and Livermore, California," *Santa Clara Lawyer* vol. 15 no. 1 (1974):
1--49.

p. 2: Growth controls "emerged as an important and increasingly common
form of land use controls" in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

p. 2: The growth controls were "designed and implemented for the express
purpose of slowing or stopping the growth rate of a jurisdiction."

p. 3: The San Jose ordinance was tide to the performance of city
schools. In particular, the growth ordinance required that residential
zoning actions by the city council could only occur if the new
development had or would cause the overcrowding of schools (except in
those cases where the developer formed contracts with the affected
schools to provide facilities). Furthermore, the ordinance gave school
districts an avenue for directing land use decisions. The ordinance also
required a study of environmental, population, and economic factors and
how they would be impacted.

p. 3: San Jose's growth was tied to a World War II philosophy
emphasizing the connection between growth and success.

p. 6: "California, by ballot initative, created Coastal Zone Commissions
with authority to approve or reject all new development within one
thousand yards of the coastline." -- an example of mandating land use
controls.

p. 6: At the local level, ". . . California, under the Porter-Cologne
Water Quality Act, regional water-quality control boards have been
granted the power to forbid new sewer hook-ups and hence to block most
new development where water quality standards are being violated. Since
1971, such moratoria on development have been imposed in Marin County
and several other localities."

p. 8: Categorizes growth controls into five areas:

1. "some growth controls take the form of performance standards, applied
   either on a temporary or permanent basis." (8)
2. "some controls have attempted to set an absolute limit on growth and
   prohibit any new development after the limit has been reached." (8)
3. "They have limited the number of new housing units to be built in any
   one year." (8)
4. "some cities have considered purchasing land available for
   development, either in fee or as open space easements."^[*Kamrowski
   v. Wisconsin*, 31 Wis. 2d 256, 142, N.W.2d 793 (1966) ruled that
   local governments could purchase open space as a valid purchase of a
   property right.] (9)
5. "temporary total moratoria often are used to control growth." (10)

Quoting the Stanford Environmental Law study: "San Jose's shape defies
description. . . . The city limits wander haphazardly over the map."
(11)

p. 12: "During the period 1965--1970, the average number of building
permits issued was 7,377 annually. Since 1970, however, the number of
new dwelling units built per year has been increasing. In 1971, building
permits were granted for a total of 10,650 new units, and the average
number of new building permits since 1970 has approached 9,000. Public
school population has trebled since 1960."

The growth ordinance was not a "stop growth" ordinance. Both ordinances
in Livermore and San Jose were adopted by ballot initiatives after the
city council refused to pass them. "The passage of each ordinance
constituted a significant political upset, since the official power
structures of each city and the traditionally effective non-governmental
interests opposed the growth control measures." (14)

Deutch concludes that the ordinances resulted out of a sense of
"frustration" rather than a program "to meet the problems of
uncontrolled growth." (14)

Noting that the ad hoc group behind the San Jose ordinance was a group
called Citizens for Rational Planning, composed of representatives from
the League of Women Voters, Alliance of Homeowners, Almaden Mother's
Group, and the Sierra Club. Opponents of the ordinance included the
Mayor and majority of city council members, builders, construction
unions, the Chamber of Commerce, and minority organizations. (14)

p. 15: "Although the growth control initiative was on the ballot in an
election where a majority of city council seats were being contested,
only 21% of the eligible voters actually cast their ballots in the
election. Fifty-three percent of those voting supported the initiative."

p. 15: "The San Jose ordinance is tied exclusively to school problems:
specifically, the fact that nine of the twenty-three school districts
within the city limits were either overcrowded or on double sessions."

    -   **Interesting to note that these aren't environmental concerns,
        but social and infrastructural concerns.**

Quoting from the ordinance's introduction:

-   ". . . residential development not be allowed to occur in any
    neighborhood of the city were essential community services do not
    meet certain minimum standards." (16)
-   "For the foregoing reasons, it is necessary and appropriate that
    residential development be restricted for a temporary period of two
    years, during which time studies can be made of the school problem
    and other issues related to further residential development." (16)

Quoting from the ordinance:

> For a period of two years from the date this ordinance becomes
> effective, the City Council of San Jose shall not zone, pre-zone, or
> re-zone any land for residential use, if such land is located in a
> school district where the total area of school building construction
> per pupil of estimated enrollment, . . .

Developers and schools entered into agreements:

-   "some developers have agreed to make direct payments to the school
    district, to be used to defray the cost of temporary facilities"
    (17)
-   "Other developers have simply guaranteed a line of credit for the
    school district and promised to reimburse the district if additional
    costs are generated by the new development." (17)
-   some developers "have agreed to delay their construction according
    to an agreed timetable which the district believes will allow it to
    provide permanent facilities." (18)
-   "some developers have agreed to dedicate land or school construction
    costs rather than provide temporary facilities." (18)

An important element of the San Jose ordinance is the permanent addition
of authorizing "a school district to protest City Council re-zoning
actions." (18)

Part of the ordinance also directs a study be made of problems connected
to residential development (quoting from the ordinance):

-   "(a) How all further residential development can be allowed to take
    place only with insurance that all necessary community facilities
    will be provided concurrently with such development." (19)
-   "(b) Whether futher residential development should be allowed if it
    violates any environmental standards
