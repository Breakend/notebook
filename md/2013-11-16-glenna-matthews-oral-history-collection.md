        practicing in 1973
        * Law degree from Stanford

        database (inaudible)" (32)
            * What is this database?
        * Matthews mentions interviewing Henley and Lamborn.
    * Folder "Sig Sanchez"
        * Got his start in politics as city councilman in Gilroy, served four
        years (two terms) (1)
        * "They had ideas of taking over the county and making it the City and
        County of San Jose. It's a little exaggerated, but I think that's what
        their thinking was." (5)

* Box 1
    * Folder Albert Henley
        * Raker Act
            * Sierra Club mentioned by Henley: "the compriomise rearched with
            the Sierra Club" (9)
        * Matthews notes that in her research she found that "the population of
        elementary school children in Santa Clara County doubled in five years
        between 1947 and 1952. So this incredible growth starts even before a
        lot of the new industry." (17)
    * Folder Patricia Lamborn
        * interview mainly focuses on her experience working in electronics; she
        worked on an assembly line for National Semiconductor; poor working
        conditions, unionizing, eventually helping start ECOSH.
