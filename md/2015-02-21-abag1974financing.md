# Association of Bay Area Governments, *Financing Open Space* (1974)

p. 1: A study produced by ABAG to examine methods of purchasing open space.

p. 1: Noted another study by ABAG called *How To Implement Open Space Plans* that discuss zoning, regulation, taxation, utility control, and new administrative structures for securing open space.

p. 1: The study also points to places particularly suited for recreation. They focus on recreation because it often "has to be acquired through a formal capital imporvement program."

p. 3: The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Open Space Lands Program contributed over $28 million in grants, distributed almost equally among local and regional projects. Although they point out that the program may disappear as a future source of revenue, the Land and Water Conservation Fund would remain an important source for grants.
