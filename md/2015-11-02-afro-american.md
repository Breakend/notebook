# 1969

#### March 22

- "Willow Glen residents reject DuBois, Stokely," March 22, 1969
    - Story about councilwoman Virginia Shaffer who rejects the hanging of portraits of Stokely Carmichael and William DuBois at the Willow Glen branch library for Negro History Week.
    - Her complaints come from Willow Glen residents. One of these residents, Mr. and Mrs. R. W. Petty, wrote Shaffer that "their long record speaks all too clearly of their opposition to our form of government."
    - Councilman John Lisher contended that rejecting the hanging of portraits was "tantamount to book burning."
