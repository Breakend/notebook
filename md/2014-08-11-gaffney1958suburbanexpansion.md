M. Mason Gaffney, "Urban Expansion--Will it Ever Stop?" *Yearbook of Agriculture* 1958.

p. 506: Discussing urban values, says "they are prodigious" and "there is
nothing modest about the prices of urban land." Gaffney reports that
residential lots in "respectable established neighborhoods" can sell for $50
to $250 a foot; apartment sites averaging $1,000 along places like Lake Shore
Drive in Chicago. Shopping districts can sell for $1,000 a foot. "The best
industrial sites in large central cities command well over 100 thousand
dollars an acre."

p. 508: "A striking aspect of today's cities is their rapid outward thrust."
Cities "gobble up farmland at will." While no comprehensive survey exists, the
essay estimates that 400,000 acres a year (1957) are being overrun by urbanization.

p. 509: "the city moves out hither and yon with little apparent consistency or
reason."

p. 510: "Asking prices for comparable lands vary widely with the seller's
finances, tax position, information, sentiments, or just plain cussedness."

p. 510: Citing a study by Jack Lessinger of the University of California's
Real Estate Research Program:

> ...has found tentatively that in the Santa Clara Valley, around San Jose, it
> is the smaller farmers who succumb earliest to the city, and larger
> landholders who hold out longest. (510)
