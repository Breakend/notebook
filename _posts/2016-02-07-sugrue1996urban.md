## Synopsis

Thomas Sugrue analyzes how race, deindustrialization, and housing intersected in 
Detroit between 1940 and 1960. Sugrue finds the urban crisis stemming from the 
postwar years rather than the 1960s, charting racial inequality, grassroots 
conservatism, and housing in shaping the structural explanations for 
inequality. Historical actors were constrained by cultural racism, 
deindustrialization, federal housing policies, but also workplace 
discrimination, local political movements, and neighborhood and class 
divisions that shape the racial landscape.

Concurrently, Sugrue examines the rise of grassroots conservatism, pushing 
against the narrative that conservatism was a backlash against the Great 
Society. Sugrue finds the conservative movement much earlier, whose politics 
centered around the protection of prosperity in the workplace and home.

Finally, Sugrue looks to housing to push against the "ghettoization" narrative 
and notes that poor whites could not afford to flee affluent suburbs, while 
blacks entering into white neighborhoods were often middle and upper class, 
leaving behind poor blacks in neighborhoods that declined. Simultaneously, 
white homeowners resisted black entrance into their neighborhoods, placing 
limits on their entry through restrictive covenants, municipal policies, and 
discriminatory lending policies.
