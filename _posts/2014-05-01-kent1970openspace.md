p. 1: "Since the end of World War II, large metropolitan regions everywhere have been permitted to grow so rapidly and with such lack of effective controls that many are now dangerously disorganized."

p. 1: In "fortunate metropolitan areas" like the San Francisco Bay Area "with significantly smaller populations [than Los Angeles or New York], where unusual topography and other factors have kept postwar suburban tract development within a radius that can be served by rail-transit commuter service, it is still possible to shape the central cities and their suburbs into new, larger, more unified, and more productive metropolitan communities without having to reclaim large amounts of developed land for the open space system."
