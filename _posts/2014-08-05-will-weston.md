Weston was born in Oakland, CA, in 1884 to parents newly arrived from New
England. He graduated with a B.A. in economics from the University of
California-Berkeley in 1913 and purchased a pear orchard in Santa Clara
County, and eventually controlled 270 acres known as Peraleda Ranch. He also
held membership in several agricultural and community organizations, including
the Santa Clara City and the California Chambers of Commerce and the
Commonwealth Club of California. He was an original appointee to the Santa
Clara County Planning Commission and a member of the San Francisco Bay Area
Council in the late 1940s and early 1950s.  Seeing the rapidly expanding urban
areas led him to conclude that zoning could be used as tools, noting that
cities used zoning to keep residences from encroaching on industrial areas. Thus, he "couldn't see why agricultural zoning shouldn't keep residences out
too." Karl Belser eagerly jumped on the idea.^[[conard1985greengold](), 9-10.]
