Opening by Lois Hogle:

> In 1959 a band of citizens in the Palo Alto-Los Altos Hills area organized

> catalyst for their concern was a proposal by Stanford University that 254
> acres be annexed to Palo Alto to allow industrial development west of what
> is now Foothill Expressway but was then a small road winding along the foot
> of the hills. A referendum was held to decide the issue, but the opposition
> was well organized and the pro open space forces lost.
>
> Though we were defeated, our interest in the issue of land use planning did
> not diminish. After a lapse of time, it became clear that this group should
> continue its efforts as there was still a great deal to preserve of that
> beautiful foothill backdrop of Palo Alto.

Reflecting on earthquakes and the slow transformation of the hills. He
concludes that "If those hills visibly change, it will not be geological
forces that change them. It will be ourselves." (8)
    * "Some of the things that go on outside our windows are less reassuring,
    incomparably swifter, immeasurably more destructive, and a thousand times more
    visible than natural forces produce. Industrial society in an area of
    expansive growth does not move with the dignity of geological change. The
    roads, cuts, and buildings of subdivisons, even much landscaping, have no
    slow inevitability about them. They are imposed on hills by force, they
    obey no natural laws, they do no conform themselves to the terrain but
    conform the terrain to themselves. They allow for no gradual adjustments
    of erosional surfaces and channels, they permit no defensive adaptations
    that might let the wild species with whom our life is inextricably
    entangled find modified niches in a modified ecology. By luck, foresight,
    and the whimsies of economics there are blessed exceptions, blessed
    pockets of nearly-untouched naturalness; but most of what people have done
    to the hills they have done ruthlessly, against the grain, without
    foresight or concern for consequences. In most cases it has not even been
    home-owners themselves who have bent the hills to their own desires." (8)

"development, when uncontrolled and too dense, is about as aesthetic as
ringworm" (12)

"Many who work hard to protect the hills don't live in them, and those who do
live in them fight just as hard to protect Alaska wilderness or Montana
grassland that they will never see." (12, 14)

The hills stretch "from the Golden Gate to Monterey Bay, the low Santa Cruz
Mountains form a barrier, northeast to southwest, between cold ocean and hot
inland valleys. They catch twice as much rain from Pacific storms as do the
lowlands on either side, and so feed both the surface and sub-surface water
channels that distribute water throughout the year. The intercept the
prevailing westerlies and mediate between Pacific fog and inland sun, forming
a marvelous air conditioner nearly a hundred miles long that guarantees the
Peninsula the finest year-round climate in the whole round world." (14)

Stegner flips the old saying: "If you don't like the weather, drive five miles
north, or five miles south, or two miles west." (14)

The hills are "watershed and view-shed for everyone from the foothills to the
bay and beyond. Though high density development might not affect the
micro-climates substantially, it would certainly bring consequences. Heavy
rains falling on forest and grassland are soaked up by soil, held back by
trees and shrubs and roots and spongy duff. Even on steep slopes they do not
run off in floods, but found their way more slowly into the creeks, and, more
importantly, into the percolation channels that renew the underground water
table of the entire valley. But roads, roofs, parking areas, and tennis courts
do not absorb rain; they shed it. In normal years, with the aid of human
engineering the creeks will carry it off. A lot of it is diverted from the
percolation channels, but at lest it doesn't flood the lowlands. But in an
abnormal year, especially if heavy rains coincide with a series of high tides
that interfere with free flow into the bay, water can overflow even the
concrete troughs we turn the creeks into, and dwellers in bayshore districts
may be wading knee deep in their living rooms. That combination of rain and
tides produced damaging floods in 1955, when the hills were comparatively
undeveloped. Another such rain-year in the 1980s could have consequences far
worse." (18)

"What that suggests . . . is that further building in the hills should be done
with great caution; that in the public interest developers must be controlled
in the numbers and kinds of houses they build and the areas they pave over and
the views they destroy; that instead of serving a public need for housing they
are actually building up a heritage of headaches and the possibility of
serious floods. Nature knows more about the control of watersheds than
builders or planning commissions have yet learned. Communities on the
Peninsula that do not allow for open space---not token open space but
extensive and natural open space---endanger both themselves and the
communities around and below them." (18, 20)

"What is more, they little by little take the joy out of daily living, . . .
they obliterate the ecology of the grassy hills and wooded ravines and brushy
creek banks, they overflow the winter creeks and dry up the summer ones, they
unknowingly or uncaringly doom dozens of species of wild things to local
extinction. And they starve they eye that craves beauty. They substitute for
voluptuous bare hills and green slopes formed and softened by natural forces
the crude shelves and benches and cuts of bulldozers." (20)

A section on "Victories and Defeats"

* "Skyline Ridge"
    * Remembrance by Eleanor Boushey
    * Scenic Highway plan adopted by the state in 1963
    * 1965 Highway One became a State Scenic Highway
    * Lois Hogle, Fran Spangle
    * The Skyline Boulevard was threatened in 1969 by Japanese lumber market.
    The Committee fought back and helped pass the State Forest Practices Act
    allowing urban communities more control over logging.
    * 1972 passage of the Mid-Peninsula Open Space District
* "Stanford Lands"
    * Remembrance by Frances Spangle
    * In 1968 the CGF urged LAFCO to assign lands west of Junipero Serra
    Freeway to Woodside and Portola Valley to be open space and lower density
    uses. Stanford planned for the lands to be used for the Webb Ranch and
    future development, hoping that the Menlo Park LAFCO would get the sphere
    of influence for the lands. (28)
    * Ampex withdrew its bid in 1960 and established a plant on Coyote Hill.
    Controversy over Coyote Hill emerged again in 1969, at Page Mill and
    Foothill Expressway, when the city approved a subdivision on the hilltop
    and destroyed its open space. The Committee sued Palo Alto on the grounds
    that subdivision procuedures were illegal and that two council members had
    a conflict of interest. After two years an out of court negotiation
    settled the matter; Stanford was granted 20 and 51 years open space
    easements on the Page Mill side of the hill. (28)
    * In 1971 Stanford issued a new land use plan and solicited comments by
    neighboring communities. The plan recommended that three-fourths of open
    land be reserved for academic use, and some areas be devoted to industry
    and housing. The "Academic Reserve" would include research and
    administrative development. Through the seventies the university expanded
    the industrial park in the foothills, built Oak Creek apartments up on
    Willow Road, the Linear Accelerator acquired a new ring, and the
    population of the campus grew to 48,000. (29)
* "Coastside"
    * Remembrance by Lennie Roberts
* "Farmlands"
    * Remembrance by Ciddy Wordell
    * In 1953 95,000 acres in Santa Clara County were zoned "exclusive
    agriculture." Still the county lost thousands of acres. (32)
    * In 1979 the CGF protested a proposed subdivison of 1300 acres of the
    Bloomfield Ranch west of Gilroy into 29 estate parcels. Since the Ranch
    was under the Williamson Act and required to remain agricultural use, the
    CGF charged that it would violate the contract. The subdivison was denied
    by the Board of Supervisors. (32)
    * "Thirty percent of Santa Clara County land is in agricultural
    use---about 37,000 acres in orchards and crops, and 225,000 acres in
    ranching. Most of that in the rural areas is prime soil---class I and II,
    the best the earth has to offer---available for agriculture. But maps
    colored green do not make a greenbelt. Lands zoned "exclusive agriculture"
    do not make an agricultural preserve. Subdivisons are still proposed and
    granted; cities still expand and cover up this precious resource with
    building and roads." (32)
* "The Challenge for the Future"
    * by CGF president Howard Wilshire
    * "If we do not work hard against the forces of modern 'progress' we will
    see a life style forecast long ago by Chief Seattle of the Pacific
    Northwest Tribes: *The end of living and the beginning of survival*."
