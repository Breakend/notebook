pp. 15-16: Sturgeon is revising the origin story of Silicon Valley. Most
accounts date the region's history to 1955 with the founding of Shockley
Semiconductor (and its spinoff Fairchild Semiconductor) or with Hewlett
Packard's founding in 1938 or Varian Associates' founding in 1948. Instead,
Sturgeon argues that this narrative cuts short Silicon Valley's history and
"divorce[s] the region from the economic geography of the greater San Francisco
Bay Area." HP and Varian were not the first electronics companies to arise near
Stanford, nor should [Frederick Terman]() be given the central role as
a catalyst for regional electronics.

p. 16: Instead, Sturgeon seeks to show that Silicon Valley has been a center of
electronics manufacturing and played a key role in the fields of radio,
television, and military electronics for far longer. He aims to "undermine the
myth of 'instant industrialization' that has been so central to the story of
Silicon Valley's development." Instead, Sturgeon finds that the story is instead
a "long time to build up momentum [of industrialization]" and is "profoundly
structured by place and historical context, and acquires path-dependent
characteristics that continue to influence outcomes far into the future."

pp. 16-17: Sturgeon argues that the elements of Silicon Valley so lauded today
(relationship between local industry and research universities; electronics,
equipment, communications, instrumentation, and military electronics; inter-firm
cooperation; tolerance for spinoffs; awareness of existing outside the
bureaucratic firms of the East Coast) all have cultural roots between 1910 and
1940.

p. 17: The most immediate ancestor to the modern electronics industry is radio.

pp. 18-19: A Naval contract in 1909 sought to improve the range that the Navy could
reach its ships off shore with radio, in inclement weather and at distances not
before possible for its Arlington, Virginia, shore radio station. The contract
for improving the system was originally won by NESCO, beating out American
Marconi, Telefunken, and RTC. But in 1912 Cyril Elwell, an engineer with the
Palo Alto-based Federal Telegraph Corporation and Stanford graduate, approached
the Navy with a new transmission technology. The design proved so successful
that FTC would later design and install the world's first global-scale radio
communication system. FTC remained a key player in the Bay Area electronics
industry, and would become a career incubator for Leonard Fuller and Charles
Litten, as well as Frederick Terman, who interned at the company in the 1920s
before attending MIT.

p. 19: Stanford helped fund FTC, thirty years before Stanford would help HP
start their company.

p. 21: In a comparison test between the FTC and NESCO spark transmitters, Elwell's
new design far outperformed the NESCO unit. On the spot, the Navy ordered ten
thirty-kilowatt arc transmitters and led one scholar to call FTC "the navy's
darling of the World War I period."
