To accommodate the influx of newcomers, San Jose needed to expand its
infrastructure and needed ways to pay for it. Local citizens voted on bond
issues, but the city also needed state and federal money. (97)

The biggest system that needed support was the sewer system. According to Philip
Trounstine and Terry Christensen: "San Jose's greatest weapon in the annexation
wars was its control of the sewer system. What water was to Los Angeles, sewage
was to San Jose. . . . San Jose used this sewage monopoly in its battles with
adjacent cities and with recalcitrant landowners."^[Quoted in Matthews, 98.]

Matthews notes resistance to expansion, especially from Santa Clara County
Planning Director Karl Belser. In 1950, Santa Clara adopted a new charter that
allowed for a strong executive to provide leadership. Local growers' communities
offered one avenue of resistance but more than not sold out. Many growers were
willing to sell, but city officials gave even more incentive to do so. Hamann
and his team went door-to-door locating growers willing to sell, and offered
zoning that would enhance grower's land. Furthermore, most growers were small
landowners whose operations provided marginal profit. Those resistant to growth
managed to pass the Greenbelt Law in 1955, but without support from
agriculturalists efforts to preserve land for orchards fell short (102). One county
official noted: "You could always tell when an orchard was getting ripe for
subdivision, because the prune trees would be bulldozed out and strawberries
would go in. That's a quick one-season crop while you wait for a buyer with the
right price."^[Quoted in Matthews, 102.]

In 1958, two geographies assessed the toll on the land:

> Asphalt has covered much of the best soil. Only crops producing highest
> returns have been able to survive. Soaring land values threaten to crowd out
> even those crops which grow better here than anywhere else. Soil conversion
> statistics indicate that 257 acres of land have been used in this county to
> accomodate each 1,000 of population increase.^[Quoted in Matthews, 102.]

Karl Belser bitterly vented: "Perhaps the only use we will ever find for the
hydrogen bomb will be to erase this great mistake from the face of the
earth."^[Quoted in Matthews, 102.]
