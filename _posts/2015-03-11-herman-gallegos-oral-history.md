pp 16-17: "The Sal Si Puedes area has now been badly divided by
freeways, but it would really be bounded by Alum Rock Avenue on the
north, Tully Road on the south, Highway 101 on the west and White Road
on the east. What used to be a very small neighborhood is now expanded
with hundreds of hastily-built tract homes that have become quite
blighted. That area is probably 95 percent Mexican now."
