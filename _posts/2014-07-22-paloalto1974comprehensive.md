> Palo Alto Planning Commission. *Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan*. July 1, 1974.

p. 45: The 1970 Census reported that 50,282 people were employed in Palo Alto,
the highest ratio of jobs to population than any other Bay Area community.
Between 1960 and 1970, the Census found that the number of workers commuting
into Palo Alto increased from 20,000 to 40,000, while those commuting out of
the city dropped slightly. The report notes that this makes the city "an
employment center" that "contributes to the city's sound fiscal condition, but
also pushes housing costs higher and aggravates traffic problems." The report
forecasted that 61,200 persons would be employed in Palo Alto by 1980, and
73,200 persons by 1990 if policies remained the same.

p. 46-47: Table of employment forecasts, 1970--1990. The table indicates that
20,200 people were employed at Stanford Industrial Park (broken down by
public/quasi-public [2,200], professional/office [2,800], and manufacturing
[15,200]). In Palo Alto as a whole, the table suggests the city had 50,250
workers in 1970 (public/quasi-public [9,300], professional/office [12,600],
commercial [6,700], manufacturing [21,650]).
