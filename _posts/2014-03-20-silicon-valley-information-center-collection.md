Scope and Content
-----------------

This collection consists of materials compiled by the San José Public Library which document the creation and developing culture of the high tech industry in the Silicon Valley from 1986 through 1993. There are several companies represented in the collection outside of the San Francisco Bay area some of which are located in southern California and some in other states. Over 600 companies are represented in this collection and there are also separate news clippings files related to many of these companies. The collection was, at the time, a global technology reference service as well as serving the needs of job seekers, students, employees doing company projects, specialized researchers and other libraries. The collection contains press releases, prospectuses, backgrounders, annual and quarterly reports, photographs, speeches, company periodicals, product literature, and other printed matter.

Notes
-----

Probably not much of use here, actually. Most of this material might be too recent; but furthermore, the collection sounds as though it wouldn't be as interested in collecting some of the environmental stories of Silicon Valley. My hunch is that most of the material here is more specifically about companies and tends to celebrate more than criticize.
