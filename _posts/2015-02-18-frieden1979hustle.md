# Chapter 1

p. 4: "A closer look at how the growth control and environmental coalition operates in local controversies shows that its effects are far less benign. It has made a clear and substantial contribution to the escalation of new home prices; yet its success in discouraging homebuilding has failed to produce important environmental benefits for the public at large. Instead it has protected the environmental, social, and economic advantages of established suburban residents who live near land that could be used for new housing."

p. 4: "This book investigates a national anti-growth movement by concentrating on California."

pp. 4-5:

> Why is California the outstanding national example of opposition to home
> building? During most of its history California welcomed newcomers. Through
> the mid-1960s its local governments were making plants for more growth. By
> the early 1970s one community after another began putting up barriers to keep
> out new residents and electing officials who ran on no-growth platforms. Even
> such strongholds of local boosterism as San Jose rejected their earlier
> belief in the unqualified benefits of growth and reversed direction abruptly.
>
> One of the reasons for this reversal on growth was the wave of urban
> development that swept across California in the 1960s. Builders worked
> overtime not only to keep up with the move to suburbia that the whole country
> experienced but also to make room for the huge migration that was special to
> California. The results were visible all over. To many people, continued
> growth looked like a threat to the qualities that attracted them to
> California in the first place---its spacious communities, magnificent
> scenery, and outstanding resources for the good life of outdoor leisure.

- **Growth liberalism**

p. 5: "The politics of no-growth required the invention of new tactics to discourage homebuilding. . . . Their tactics included putting land into agricultural preserves, declaring moratoria on new water and sewer connections, setting explicit growth quotas, establishing service boundaries beyond which there would be no extensions of utility lines, charging thousands of dollars in 'hook-up' fees for each new house as a price for local public service, and creating a climate of hostility that encouraged all opposition groups to bring pressure against proposed new developments."

p. 6: Between 1972 and 1975, environmental lawsuits challenged developments containing 29,000 new housing units.

p. 8: "Many growth opponents use environmental arguments to mask other motives, such as fears of property tax increases or anxieties about keeping their community exclusive. Environmental rhetoric has become a valued currency for public debate, with much greater voter appeal than arguments that appear more narrowly self-interested."

p. 9: "Environmental opposition to homebuilding has almost no connection to mainstream conservation issues, such as reducing pollution and eliminating environmental health hazards."

pp. 9-10: "Environmental groups have helped to stop a series of housing developments located within short commuting distances of the main job centers around San Francisco. The result has been to push homebuilding farther out to scattered sites at the fringes of the urban area, where the new residents will use more gas and pollute more air while they drive longer distances to work."

p. 10: Suggests that the environmental impulse to protect open space comes from the ideology of preservation, not conservation. But he suggests their concerns only serve to protect their own interests. "They try to guard well-to-do suburbs against change, and the environment they protect is a local environment their affluent members can afford to enjoy."

# Chapter 2

p. 27: "San Jose is the environmentalists' favorite horror story."

p 28: Quoting an architectural guide to northern California:

> Nowhere has more productive soil been paved over, more beautiful agricultural
> landscape transformed into endless tract houses, strip commercial development
> and wirescape---a garden demolished. Yet in its place has emerged a new
> garden for people. Santa Clara Valley now shelters hundreds of thousands of
> working people and their families. It provides them with nearly every
> imaginable service close at hand. And it blesses them, as it did the prunes,
> with a particularly salubrious climate only lately somewhat blemished by
> nitrous oxide emissions.^[David Gebhard, Robert Montogmery, Robert Winter, John Woodbridge, and Sally Woodbridge, *A Guide to Architecture in San Francisco and Northern California* (Santa Barbara: Peregrine Smith, 1973), 166.]

p. 28: The rapid growth of San Jose created new industries: construction and retail trade flourished, alongside the new industrial activity of electronics, aerospace, and manufacturing.

p. 28: Starting in the 1960s it became clear city services were not keeping up with growth: crowded schools, congested roads, air pollution. Voters, troubled by rising taxes, began refusing bonds for public improvements. Two pro-growth candidates were defeated in 1969, and the pro-growth city manager retired in 1970. In 1970, the city council declared a urban development policy with the goal to "insure that San Jose's future growth will proceed in an orderly, planned manner to achieve a balanced composition of industrial, commercial, residential and public uses."^[Robert Feinbaum, "The Politics of Growth in the 'Valley of Heart's Delight'," *California Journal* 7 (March 1976): 95--98, quoted p. 98.]

p. 29: San Jose divided vacant land into three districts: urban service area, urban transition area, and urban reserve. All future development was limited to urban service areas.^[Research Division of the Urban Land Institute and Gruen Gruen + Associates, *Effects of Regulation on Housing Costs: Two Case Studies* (Washington, D.C.: Urban Land Institute, 1977), 11--13.]

pp. 29--30: In April 1973 a new ordinance emerged from problems around schools. Parents and teachers frustrated by crowded schools urged officials to block new housing developments where schools were already overcrowded. Between April 1973 and January 1975, San Jose processed 135 zoning applications in 16 school districts. Almost none were turned down due to school overcrowding issues, which seemed to indicate builders moved to avoid heavily impacted areas.

p. 31: Quoting a developer from a Rand study: "the bureaucracies are larger, the rules are more numerous, and there is no inclination to 'find the way' to do something. Today we have to do what there already is a way for."^[E. S. Rolph, *Decision-Making by Residential Developers in Santa Clara County* (Santa Monica: Rand Corporation, August 1973), 21.]

p. 31: The Rand study found that developers avoided doing what the San Jose ordinance hoped to encourage, citing problems with negotiating with agencies that had become too costly. Developers pursed traditional single-family detached homes on separate lots rather than San Jose's hope for homes clustered around a common open space rather than large lots for individual houses, or moderate-density housing such as condominiums and town houses.

# Chapter 8

p. 107: This chapter and the previous claims that environmentalists abused technical studies in order to slant findings or look at issues narrowly. In particular to this chapter, Frieden is looking at Palo Alto.

p. 107: "A technical study found that the least expensive form of development from the point of view of city taxpayers was no development at all, even if the city had to buy a large amount of land at market prices in order to block homebuilding." [Referring here to the Livingston and Blayney study]

p. 107: In the 1960s as developers began planning property, the city commissioned an "environmental design study" to determine what sort of development should happen in the foothills. The city commissioned the Livingston and Blayney firm to study the issue.

p. 108: The early study reports in 1969 suggested no reason to keep housing out of the foothills initially:

> A number of differing aesthetic judgments can be made about development of
> the foothills, and none can fairly claim exclusive validity. In the eyes of
> some observers, the beauty of the area will be destroyed if there is any
> significant amount of development. Others would prefer to see the rolling
> foothills made greener by development of relatively small lot subdivisions
> . . . with ornamental tree plantings and well-tended gardens covering almost
> every square foot. . . . even steeper slopes have been developed with
> aesthetically satisfying results. Night views of developed hillsides studded
> with sparkling lights are pleasing to most people.^[Livingston and Blayney, *Foothills Environmental Design Study: Report No. 1 to the City of Palo Alto*, (October 1969), p. 32..]

p. 108: The study also saw no reason to add further recreation in the foothills since Palo Alto already had recreational areas, including a 1,400-acre park. The firm admitted that building homes near the existing open space would remove some of its wilderness character and that communities without open space could use Palo Alto for recreational needs.

pp. 108--109: "Palo Alto's residents enjoyed an exceptionally favorable tax arrangement. Over the years the city had managed to attract high tax-paying development---light industry and office buildings---while blocking population growth that might have led to increased demands for public services. As a result the city and its school district were able to provide high-quality services at very low cost to local homeowners. Palo Alto's property tax rate was only half as high as the average for cities in Santa Clara County; yet its expenditures per capita were twice the countywide average." **In other words, business firms footed most of the bill for Palo Alto, including educating its children.**

p. 109: New home construction would do little to raise tax revenues to pay for additional school costs, nor would local revenue increase much compared to the cost of new schools.

p. 109:

> Tax advantages might be critical in a heavily burdened or low-income
> community, but Palo Alto's residents were well-to-do and lightly taxed.
> Business and industry paid most of its tax bills and would continue to do so.
> The consultants, in fact, projected further substantial increases in
> industrial development in the future. These would surely cover any tax
> deficit resulting from new housing.

pp. 109-110: Not only did the firm frame its recommendations around tax issues, but also environmental issues. They praised the Sierra Club and the Committee for Green Foothills for creating awareness of ecological issues in Palo Alto and challenging the idea of growth-is-good. They concluded in their study that environmentalists' fears were confirmed: "Development unquestionably would radically alter the ecology and the visual aspect of the foothills." Plus, "extreme caution will be necessary if landslides and floods are to be avoided."^[Quoted from the report, p. 110.]

p. 110: The firm eventually concluded that all development should be blocked throughout the foothills, and urged that the city work with neighboring cities to buy the foothills for regional open space.

p. 110: Frieden criticizes the firm's recommendations: "As far as housing was concerned, however, they had tunnel vision. Palo Alto had serious housing problems and the city government was well aware of them. Yet the consulting study gave only narrow and inadequate attention to the impact their proposals would have on the local housing market."

p. 111: Noting a study prepared by the Palo Alto planning department that offered reasons why low-cost housing was disappearing from the city. First, they suggested that housing demand was great because the city was an attractive place to live, and partly because it was a major job center (50,000 jobs but only 20,000 resident households).^[Cites Palo Alto Planning Department, "The Problem of Housing in Palo Alto," July 23, 1970, p. 2.]

p. 111: Advocates for low-income groups were vocal about their demands. At a city council meeting in July 1970, a speaker for the Stanford Labor Action Group spoke: "Poor people are eliminated to make more room for high-income people, making Palo Alto a canyon of finance. . . . a united front is developing in Palo Alto of the black, brown and street people who are being evicted from their premises. . . . the hospital has been stopped, traffic has been stopped, and you people will be stopped."^[Quoted from Council of the City of Palo Alto, Committee of the Whole, "Minutes of the Meeting of July 27, 1970," pp. 5--6.]

p. 111: A member of the East Palo Alto Tenants' Union spoke up in the same council meeting, where he "stated there are hundreds of people on waiting lists to get into homes in East Palo Alto and if Palo Alto's plans continue, the housing shortage in East Palo Alto will be even more serious. . . . The people in East Palo Alto are very concerned with the housing shortage in Palo Alto and stand united for a moratorium on the superblock, demolition on existing houses, and no evictions until the housing needs are met. . . . He commented that if the people of Palo Alto are so proud of their city, they had better do something about low-income housing, because if they don't, they won't have a city to be proud of much longer."^[Quoted from Council of the City of Palo Alto, Committee of the Whole, "Minutes of the Meeting of July 27, 1970," pp. 4--5.]

p. 112: Frieden argues that "homebuilding in the foothills would have helped meet a region-wide need for housing to keep up with population growth. Palo Alto's growth strategy of maintaining its privileged tax status as a major job center, while imposing on other communities the costs of housing its workers, had important implications in a regionwide housing market. Yet the same consultants who looked at regional open space needs were unwilling to look at regional housing needs or even to look adequately at local ones."

p. 112: The Blayney and Livingston study downplayed social advantages, writing that "proposed park expansion aside, none of the alternates studied would have any great social utility except those that include low-moderate income housing . . ., and these would have significant disadvantages in other respects." Those disadvantages included widening streets, ecological and aesthetic damage, and potential landslides and flood problems.

p. 113: In August 1969 the development group Arastra Limited Partnership proposed a new 530-acre tract in the foothills, half of which would be open space and the other the building of 1,776 housing units (apartments, town houses, and single-family homes). Three months later, the Livingston and Blayney report was released, including that the Arastra land was well suited for development. A special study by the firm also concluded that the site was reasonable. Economic studies also found that, although the annual tax surplus would not quite cover the costs to the school district, the discrepancy wasn't so much that it was unreasonable to develop. Furthermore, industrial development would cover the tax deficit easily. Frieden argues: "These findings showed that housing in the foothills would not create new tax burdens for other Palo Alto residents as long as Palo Alto kept attracting new industry. They also showed, however, that Palo Alto's taxpayers could improve their already good situation still further by getting new industry *without* allowing any new homebuilding." (113)

p. 113: In early 1970 the city council held hearings on the Arastra plan, urging the developer to reduce the number of units on the property. The developer reduced the number of units to 1,500 and also proposed to set aside 45 acres for the Palo Alto Housing Corporation, a private nonprofit housing sponsor to manage 200 low- to moderate-cost housing. The council voted down the plan but expressed its willingness to consider a new plan.

p. 113: By the end of May, the council voted to delay Arastra's plans until the Livingston and Blayney firm completed their third report. (The final report came out in June). The city council held a public hearing on the Arastra proposal in November, which was enthusiastically supported by the Committee for Green Foothills, League of Women Voters, Palo Alto Branch of the American Association of University Women, Palo Alto Civic League, and the Loma Prieta Chapter of the Sierra Club. There was no speakers in opposition. The city then voted to accept the Livingston and Blayney report, meaning that the Arastra land would be purchased by the city as open space.

p. 114: The city explored possibilites for state and federal aid to purchase the foothill land, establishing a six-month moratorium on development in July 1971 to prevent any possible development proposals. The city failed to come up with private and public funds to purchase the land by the end of six months, and extended the moratorium an attidional six months. In 1972, the Palo Alto planning department proposed a less expensive way to proceed: they suggested zoning rather than city purchase of the foothills. In May the city approved highly restrictive zoning regulations and applied the zoning to the parcels of land the city intended to purchase. The new zoning regulation only allowed agriculture, botanical conservatories, outdoor nature laboratories, wildlife sanctuaries, guest ranches, riding academies, clubs, stables, golf courses, and educational and philanthropic institutions to operate in the zoned areas. Single-family residences were allowed provided that lot sizes were 10 acres, and no more than 3.5% of the site held structures or roads on it; and that all housing on adjacent lots were clustered together.

p. 115: Arastra informed the city that it was prepared to sell the land or develop it, but the city had to act or would face a lawsuit charging the city seized land without compensation. The city refused to make an offer on the land, and Arastra sued. After three years of legal proceedings, Arastra won the case. The U.S. District Court for northern California criticized Palo Alto's tactics. Although the city's ordinance claimed to protect life and property, public health, safety, and welfare, and protect the community from fire, flood, and seismic activity, the US Court saw the ordinance differently. They argued:

> By 1972, it began to appear that the costs of acquisition were going to be
> substantially higher than had originally been hoped. Federal funds were not
> available, no gifts of land had been generated, the land's values . . . would
> have required expenditures of substantial public funds and some of the larger
> taxpayers were expressing objections.
>
> While the costs were high, the City remained anxious to prevent development
> and to preserve open space. All development had been foreclosed during the
> period, but the time was running out within which it could continue to be
> prevented without some definitive action. . . . While acquisition now seemed
> less attractive, the intent to preserve the open space continued. . . .
>
> When the open space ordinance is examined in this context, it compels the
> conclusion that the City had the purpose, by way of zoning regulation, to
> accomplish without expense to the taxpayers all of the benefits it could have
> received from the acquisition.
>
> The City Council purported to find a series of health and safety factors,
> that were recited as little more than a formality, in order to justify the
> open space ordinance. They had no adequate information before them to support
> any such findings. The found, for example, that the open space ordinance was
> compelled by the fire hazards of the Foothills. The only information they had
> before them was information from their own fire chief to the effect that
> a fire hazard existed in the Foothills only if the Foothills were to remain
> in their natural condition and that any hazard from fire would be materially
> reduced by development. While ordinarily, the factual determination made by
> a city council to justify passage of an ordinance is final and not subject to
> judicial review, the recitation of imaginary or non-existent fire hazards can
> be considered with the other evidence to determine the purpose and effect of
> the enactment.^[*Arastra Limited Partnership v. City of Palo Alto*, U.S. District Court for Northern California, C-72-2305 RHS, "Decision," September 15, 1975,  pp. 34--35.]

p. 116: The city also cited the protection of agricultural land and protection from seisemic activity, but the Court found that little of the soil and slope characteristics of the foothills could support agriculture. The Court concluded about Palo Alto's strategy for blocking development:

> While the regulations purport to permit residential development on ten-acre
> sites, an analysis of the limitation makes it plain that no such development
> could ever have taken place. Minimum development costs would have required
> [the lots] to be marketed for at least $100,000 each. . . .
>
> It seems obvious that the purchaser of a building site at a cost of $100,000
> might plan to construct some rather elaborate structures on his ten acres,
> but the ordinance would prohibit that. Only 3 1/2 percent of the site could
> be covered with impervious construction, so roads, tennis courts, barns,
> outhouses, swimming pools, etc., would be subject to severe limitations. Nor
> would the prospective purchaser be allowed to select the most attractive
> location for his property. The regulations require both clustering of
> structures, as well as a minimum ten-acre lot size, so even though parcels
> of land are very large, the houses would be required to be grouped together
> in sight of one another. Nor could a desirable knoll be used as a building
> site, because, to protect the view from the park and the roads, sites were
> required to be unobtrusive. It was certainly totally unrealistic to expect any
> purchaser to spend such an amount of money to acquire so little freedom to
> use his property. It must be concluded that the framers of the ordinance had
> just that in mind. They designed a purported permitted use but surrounded it
> with so many limitations in order to make it, as far as they were able, a use
> that could never be made of the property.
>
> The facts as found indicate that the other uses, purportedly permitted, were
> equally unrealistic. It is plain that the objective and the effect of the
> open space regulations was not to control development, but to prevent it.^[*Arastra Limited Partnership v. City of Palo Alto*, U.S. District Court for Northern California, C-72-2305 RHS, "Decision," September 15, 1975, pp. 35--36.]

p. 117: The Court stated: "However laudable the motive to preserve scenic beauties, the City must act, not by subterfuge, but by law."^[*Arastra Limited Partnership v. City of Palo Alto*, U.S. District Court for Northern California, C-72-2305 RHS, "Decision," September 15, 1975, p. 37.]

p. 117: The Court decided in the favor of Arastra:

> The basic question of the law, then is this: If a city with power to do so,
> decided to acquire property to preserve scenic beauty, open space and the
> view from a public park and city roads, takes substantially all steps toward
> dong so, short of payment, leads the public and property owners to believe
> that the acquisition is inevitable, delays all development of the property
> while preparing for acquisition, and then, when it has determined that the
> cost is higher than hoped, on the pretense of protecting against non-existent
> hazards found to exist without substantial evidence, enacts a zoning
> ordinance, accomplishing all of the purposes of the acquisitions, with
> purports to allow uses of property which are not economically realistic, with
> no inquiry as to the economic feasibility of the purported uses, is the
> resulting loss of value to the property affected compensable? The answer must
> be "yes."^[*Arastra Limited Partnership v. City of Palo Alto*, U.S. District Court for Northern California, C-72-2305 RHS, "Decision," September 15, 1975, p. 37.]

p. 117: Palo Alto agreed to an out-of-court settlement to purchase the land for $7.5 million, but no homebuilding happened at the site.

# Chapter 9

p. 119: "There is almost no connection between housing and the big environmental issues of our times---use of toxic substances, nuclear radiation hazards, conservation of natural resources. The attack on homebuilding does not follow from the central concerns of the environmental movement. Instead it represents a stretching of the environmental agenda to issues that are marginal."

p. 125: Noting the [california1971californiatomorrow]() that "illustrates why the environmental mind-set gives short shrift to housing."

p. 126: The [california1971californiatomorrow]() plans to zone much of the state for conservation including "lands for protection of ecological, scenic, historic, and archeologic values; the preserves of threatened or unique animal or plant species; lands for conservation of water, forest, rangeland and desert resources, and game; open water, shoreline, and aquifer-recharge zones; and fire, flood, erosion, or earthquake hazard areas," as well as zoning for the protection of farmland.

p. 126: Frieden criticizes the *California Tomorrow Plan* for giving little attention to housing ("anticipated population increase in two sentences") and offers no housing goals nor place any value on future homebuilding.
