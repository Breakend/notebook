# Notes

O'Sullivan, "[Critical GIS](http://phg.sagepub.com/content/30/6/783.refs)" (2006)

Karl crediting Erik for opening up the field to critical GIS and visualization innovation. World class cartographer, but in asking the humanities to respond to what's missing or what we don't have in GIS, it presents challenges to GIS and to cartographers.

KG: My job is making problems for cartographers. [I *love* this idea.]

Questions from KG to the panel as a whole:

- "Does historical simulation open significant untapped avenues for new historical spatial narratives or is it too reductionist to be accepted or useful by humanists?
- Is there a place for performative art in the spatial humanities? Or does art lack the empirical and representational rigor that is necessary to comprehend data and derive meaning?
- What does "spatial narrative" mean?
- How does it differ from verbal narrative: is that even a meaningful distinction?
- What's missing or inadequate in existing tools, models, and methods?

## Anne Knowles, "Space and Time in Holocaust Narratives"

Fundamentals of space and time, more than narrative

Historian Friedlander's call for an integrated story of perpetrators and victims. Tried this with his two volume book.

Continental, regional, urban, individual -- looking at scales of the holocaust. (2014 -- [Geographies of the Holocaust](http://www.amazon.com/Geographies-Holocaust-Spatial-Humanities-Knowles/dp/0253012112/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431020112&sr=8-1&keywords=geographies+of+the+holocaust)) -- see Chp. 7 esp.

Hard to integrate historical geographies of victims and perpetrators. Perhaps visualizations sharpened distinctions.

Place, time, and scale -- integrations of these.

Oral history interviews as data for the spatial narratives.

- general structure of the testimonies -- can we break it down into smaller units.
- variations of scale and times of scale
- representations of elastic time in survivor's memories
- emotionally powerful memories are small, specific places (offices, tables, etc)

Are the oral history and spatial narrative together more emotional than maps?

- Anne says that it seems to cause a greater emotional response than static maps.
- maps are spatial narratives, maps tell stories -- but a two dimensional map doesn't do that, says Anne.

Nick: Connection between topology and topography?

- circles removed from Euclidian space, but the elements remain -- sizes of the circles correspond to a lat-long idea (circles for the USSR appearing to the East, e.g.)
- Italian geographers, looking at Auschwitz as a threshold to modernity (Agamben?)

## Erik Steiner

Interested in understanding how it relates to the stuff we build, and how we use that stuff in academic scholarship. The things that carry narrative power, and using digital tools and representations.

Narrative: a process and product of sense making.

The data themselves don't make the narrative -- we need the humanist interpreter.

- but we also need *art*. Understanding the rhetoric of art in scholarship and how to use them effectively. We value empiricism when data are available, but when not available or incomplete or not totally relevant we make little direct use of them.
- LitLab, e.g., is heavily empirical.
- We don't know how to handle ambiguities in ways that are not strictly empirical.
- Data representations and visualizations come almost entirely from scientific traditions, and we're uncomfortable with performative aspects of data.
- speculative data, artistic practice, process of the research
- Speculative data:
	- describing the familiar problem of dealing with incomplete, ambiguous data and what to do with them.
	- Can we, or should we, generate speculative but realistic data to fill in the gaps?
	- Privy the visualization *as* narrative.
	- [SS Concentration Camps visualization](http://stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/viz.php?id=379&project_id=0)
	- Represent uncertain data in ways that can *appear* quite certain.
	- [Mapping Mobility in Budapest Ghetto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW7_TQU7XS4)
		- Modeling where Jews go in the city. What does it mean to be Jewish in Budapest?
- Is there a place for historical simulation? Is there an untapped avenue here for building historical spatial narratives?
	- Building the Budapest visualization built a lot of tension in the team, seemed too reductionist. Would it pass muster in the historical community? Can you use the simulation as a new source, while bracketing uncertainty or discovering possibilities of ways things might have played out?
- Performative art:
	- We've borrowed too much from scientific traditions promoted by people like Tufte, throws out serendipity and expressiveness.
	- Nigel Thrift and "[nonrepresentational theory](http://www.amazon.com/Non-Representational-Theory-Politics-International-Sociology/dp/0415393213)"
	- Play and experimentation rather than precision
	- The data-driven model has driven the visualization too much.

## Nicole Coleman

"intellectual geography"

Zephyr, White, Nicole sponsored "Visualizing Complexity and Uncertainty"

Abstraction as a way of expression

Suggests visualization as a process rather than a visualization as expression

<https://milicatomic.wordpress.com/works/container/>

Expression of data

<http://www.timknowles.co.uk/Work/PathofLeastResistance/tabid/515/Default.aspx>

Thinking of data as a medium

- like pencil lead, ink
- it's expressive

Showing Ideograph tool they built

Allows the researcher to think imaginatively -- it's not interpretation interfering with a research process, but she generates herself those ideas. The end product might be a visual form.

Thinking through how to define links, inviting connection types on the fly. Allow for rearranging the nodes.

Using a layout that's appropriate to the data.

Capturing the process of research

## David O'Sullivan

Looking at environmental extraction

## Nick Bauch

How is DH changing cultural geography?

Richard Hartshorn, *The Nature of Geography* 1939 (figure on regional geography)

digital platform

- proximity to organize information
- landscape to become an epistemology

Landscape as a way of knowing

Q: "What is spatial narrative"?

- proximity as epistemology, territorially grounded space to bundle information.
