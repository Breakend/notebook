### Folder 49 "General Plan, Lawsuit, Correspondence, Court Documents,
    1981-1982"

* Letter from Valentine Miller to Editors at the San Jose Mercury, Dec
29, 1981
    * photographed
* Letter from Stahr to Hayes and City Council, Nov 11, 1981
    * LWV participating in evaluating the San Jose General Plan (1)
    * LWV speaking on its consensus positions, argues that * sewer
    lines and the treatment plant are inadequate to support additional
    growth. Allowing more homes and industry to develop would "impact
    this already overburdened system" and would be "unwise." They
    would rather the city put resources into existing communities.
        * They call for "encouraging mixed uses" -- what is this?
            * I believe this to mean mixing industrial and commercial
            uses---e.g., a mixed use proposal would combine zoning for
            light industrial, industrial park, and commercial
            designations.^[See letter from Stahr to Hayes, enclosure,
            iv, League of Women Voters, SJSU.]
        * LWV expresses their concern about expanding the service
        boundaries, quoting Hayes' campaign promise of "Better Before
        We Get Bigger." LWV says San Jose's expansions have never paid
        for themselves. They quote a memo by Planning Director
        Schoennauer (Oct. 5, 1981): "Land resources within the planned
        urban area are more than sufficient to meet the city's needs
        through 1990."
        * Nothing in the plan alleviates their concerns about hillside
        development.
        * LWV stresses "infill" and "the development of a vibrant
        downtown core."
    * The letter includes an enclosure with comments from various
    districts:
        * District 8:
            * Changes to the Silver Creek Planned Residential
            Community should require a new General Plan EIR because
            the plan (they quote the report) "does not specifically
            condone extensive hillside development on the scale
            contemplated in the Horizon 2000 Concept, the adequacy of
            the Plan EIR could be a concern."
            * Cites the inadequcy of city services to support
            expansion, including fire and police response times, water
            supply, water treatment capacity, delay in Evergreen
            Interceptor Trunk Sewer project, and roads. (2)
            * Finds the new area too far away from services,
            facilities, and employment centers.  * "Further, we wonder
            what the demand for houses in this price range will be,
            since this valley is plagued with an abundance of
            expensive housing already." (2)
            * LWV has "always questioned the development of
            ecologically sensitive areas, especially hillsides and
            flood plain. Inevitably the costs are too high." (3)
            * The district strongly supports the staff recommendation
            to deny the request. (3)
        * District 9:
            * Does not oppose the proposal, but is concerned that it
            occupies Highway 85 right-of-way that may be a potential
            cost to taxpayers in the future. (3)
        * District 10:
            * Argues that emergency vehicle response times is too long (3)
            * Asks for an analysis of the proposed development in a
            fire hazard area. (3)
            * The proposal calls for 380+ acres of the Santa Teresa
            hillside, "hardly an insignificant or 'conservative'
            expansion." They call for a new EIR to adequately address
            the proposal. (3)
            * Argues that the 1983 Annual Review should address
            development before changes to the General Plan are
            approved. (3)
            * Calls development "premature at best. This is a flood
            zone and a fault zone. Development in the Coyote Valley is
            against city policy and should be denied." (3)
            * "The League has a long history of questioning the
            appropriateness of the Oceanic Development in the Coyote
            Valley. The designation of Scheller Ave. as a major
            collector and interchange location is premature and
            growth-inducing. Further, the city has higher priorities
            for state transportation money and should not jeopardize
            those priorities." (3)

        * clipping, "S.J. Council faces thorny hillside development issue," *San Jose News* November 19, 1981
            * Critics of the development area include the League of Women
            Voters, Berryessa Citizens Advisory Council, Committee for Green
            Foothills, and San Jose Citizens Alliance.
            * Linda Elkind of CFG: Development would lead to "dense sprawl
            throughout the hillsides."
            * Colleen Thompson of Berryessa: "With sewers, police facilities,
            transportation and the operation of new parks unfunded within the
            city, how can the city afford to service this new area?"
            * Planning Director Schoennauer noted in a 1978 report that
            hillside development should be avoided because of soil and
            geological complications: investment in streets, sewers, and water
            systems; conflict with infilling neighborhoods; providing fire and
            police to "fringe areas" could drain other neighborhoods of
            resources.
            * City Manager Francis Fox calls for the hillside and Coyote
            Valley development.
                * The developer is Brandenburg?
            * He argued before the planning commission that he wanted to
            provide executive homes, a golf course designed by Arnold
            Palmer, a luxury hotel, and a roadway linking Evergreen and
            Highway 101 to the Hellyer interchange.
            * The plan for land use was adopted by the city in 1976 and has
            led the city council to refuse opening the hills to residential
            homebuilders.
            * Mayor Hayes: "There are those who eye Coyote Valley and our
            surrounding hillsides as virgin territory just waiting for massive
            development. . . . Let those people be told once again: We will
            not allow development of Coyote Valley and the hillsides. That
            land is off-limits."
            * Council members, however, have said privately (including those
            opposed to hillside development in 1980) are open to the planning
            staff's Silver Creek Hills plan.  * Councilwomen Shirley Lewis
            argued against development, writing that Silver Creek "would
            constitute abandonment of the policy of managed growth and would
            show that commitments to it were merely campaign rhetoric."
            * Schoennauer argues different: "We aren't opening up 80,000 of
            hillsides. It's not helter-skelter development. . . . The overall
            intent of the Silver Creek Planned Residential Community is to add
            flexibility to the current general plan to encourage innovation
            and creativity on the part of the private sector in development of
            the planned community and finally, to provide a comprehensive and
            managed growth strategy for the Silver Creek Valley and
            surrounding area."

        November 30, 1981.
            * Editorial of the *Mercury News*.
            * Reporting that the sewage treatment plant cannot handle
            the capacity originally promised.
            * In April, the City Manager Francis Fox and other city officials
            told the city council that they needed to raise the capacity of
            the sewage treatment plant from 132 million gallons per day to 143
            million gallons per day at a cost of \$22 million. The ("bitterly
            divided") city council voted 8-3 to float \$44 million of revenue
            bonds and raise sewer fees 38 percent.
            * Yet, sewer plant director Ed Braatelien told the council that
            132 million gallons per day capacity was achieved "using expensive
            and undependable 'Rube Goldberg' techniques." The actual capacity
            was 97 million gallons per day; raising it would cost \$59.5
            million.
            * "council members may be pardoned for feeling like rustic
            bumpkins who've just sold the family farm to take advantage of a
            once-in-a-lifetime deal on the Golden Gate Bridge."
            * "why, in the name of all the patron saints of sanitation, can't
            somebody, somewhere, somehow figure out what the capacity of the
            plant really is?"
        * clipping, "No to a backdoor proposal," *San Jose Mercury*, November
        30, 1981.
            * Editorial of the *Mercury News*
            * The newspaper is coming down hard on the city's plans to expand
            urban services to the Evergreen Valley and calls on the Santa Clara
            County Board of Supervisors to resist.
            * The paper argues that it seems like the city is attempting to
            bypass LAFCO, "whose function is to ride herd on urban expansion."

### Folder 64 "Natural Resources - Water"

* Toxics Newsletters
    * 1985 *Silicon Valley Toxics News*
        * Safe Water Council”: Created by Santa Clara County Supervisor Susanne Wilson, the         group consisted of local leaders concerned about environmental issues as well as            representatives from industry, trade associations, water utilities, and local               legislators. The group suggested eight areas for improvement: 1) Increase the staff         of the Regional Water Quality Control Board; 2) initiation of a cancer registry; 3)         a pilot program to evaluate well treatment; 4) assessment of the toxicity of TCA; 5)         pilot project for private well testing; 6) Augmentation of AB 1803 program for small         water systems; 7) change in allocation criteria for state superfund bond money; 8)          development of action levels for chemicals without existing standards.
        * “Duke Vetoes Special Budget Task Force on Toxics”: Under the leadership of John Vasconcellos of San Jose (chairman of the Ways and Means Committee), a task force was convened to address the control of toxics. The California Legislature approved a $15,000,000 budget allocation, but was vetoed by the governor.
        * “Mt View Five—Defining “How slow is too slow”: Five electronic companies in Mt. View (all on the same block) had attempted to establish each others liabilities rather than clean up toxics. SVTC and CBE found this to be “a key test case on industrial foot dragging” and, through community outreach, testimony and hearings, working with agency staff and press corp, resulted in the RWQCB issuing clean-up orders and establishing “precedent-setting cooperative agreement with EPA.”
        * “IBM Appeal—How Clean is Clean”: SVTC, CBE, the city of San Jose, and Santa Clara County joined together for an appeal to the State Water Board regarding IBM’s responsibilities to the community on the issue of “how clean is clean.” CBE served as legal and technical aspects of the appeal; SVTC worked on community liaison and outreach.
        * “Toxics Reorganization—Duke’s Last Stand”: The governor, SVTC claims, issued plans that would have “stripped the RWQCB’s of their power, relaxed clean-up standards and removed the public from the decision-making process.” The plan was killed by the legislator, as was a slightly revised plan.
        * “EPA Advisory Committee”: The EPA released their draft of a report overviewing the extent of contamination in Silicon Valley, hailed by the Semiconductor Industry Association as a “clean bill of health.” SVTC and CBE drafted a minority report explaining why Silicon Valley was different. They argue: 1) The EPA understates the risk to Public Health in Silicon Valley; 2) That water contamination requires increased efforts; 3) That air and surface toxics must be reduced; 4) What steps need to be taken and how to pay for them. An op-ed to the San Jose Mercury by Peter Steinhart “exposed the flaws of the report’s approach to risk assessment/risk management by asking: ‘If semiconductor sales lag or the price of IBM stock drops, will we raise the number of allowable cancer cases in the Santa Clara Valley?’”
        * On November 16, 1985, the US House of Representatives Public Works subcommittee on Investigation and Oversight held hearings in the San Jose City Council chambers, hearing testimony from all sides about the progress of groundwater cleanup. Chairman Oberstar (Dem., Minn) and San Jose’s Congressmen Norman Mineta and Don Edwards remarked on its significance. Supervisor Susanne Wilson “blasted Gov. Deukmejian for vetoing toxic control money for Santa Clara County” and Chairman Oberstar “repeatedly ridiculed Leo Kline, the head of the Industry Clean Water Task Force, for his assertions that TCA was well-researched and not very toxic.”
    * 1986 *Silicon Valley Toxics News*
        * Newsletter asks if Santa Clara Valley can undergo the transition from Valley of Heart’s Delight to Silicon Valley and still maintain drinking water. They rebuke industry and the EPA: “The ‘low level’ toxic contaminants presently being detected in drinking water wells that serve over 100,000 in San Jose present an ‘acceptable risk’ according to EPA officials and their friends in industry.”
        * The IBM leak was discovered five years ago at IBM’s south San Jose plant and has spread several miles as far north as Tully Road. Contamination affected 25 public and private wells, including Evergreen wells (near Tuers Road and Capitol Expressway). The leak potentially exposed as many as 100,000 San Joseans.
        * Three chemicals were detected in the wells: 1,1 Dichloroethylene (DCE), 1,1,1 Trichloroethane (TCA), and Freon 113.
        * DCE was detected in seven different tests at Evergreen wells; six samples were at 0.1 ppb and one at 2.2 ppb.
        * TCA is not classified as a carcinogen by the EPA, but recent studies suggest TCA caused tumors in animals. There’s also evidence that TCA may cause birth defects. TCA was linked to the birth defects in the Los Paseos neighborhood in south San Jose (birth defect rates fell when clean water was restored).
        * Freon 113 is not considered cancer causing, but no EPA or State Health Department standards exist for the drinking water.
        * SVTC is critical of the State Water Resources Control Board because it is “dominated by Deukmejian appointees.”
        * The SWRCB makes a decision on May 1, 1986, that will set California  policy towards groundwater cleanup for “perhaps the next four years.” The Board’s decision about the scope of cleanup and monitoring “will for the first time define the meaning of the state’s non-degradation water policy for a toxics groundwater cleanup and answer the question, ‘How clean is clean?’”
        * In 1968 the Water Board adopted what is commonly known as the “non-degradation” policy, although the State Board argues that “non-degradation” is not the right name for the policy. The parties interested in the case disagree over the terminology surrounding the policy (which was designed to protect surface waters like rivers and lakes from pollution).
        * The IBM appeal centers around what amount of contaminants can be consumed as drinking water.
        * The SVTC, CBE, Santa Clara County, and Santa Clara Valley Water District argue that the matter should belong to the Regional Board for evaluation of cleanup and treatment alternatives. IBM and the Regional Board insist that the process doesn’t need to be revisited. The City of San Jose joined the petitioners in appealing to the Water Board.
        * Petitioners argue that the Regional Board should conduct a cost benefit analysis that includes understanding how contaminated areas affect real estate prices, the psychological effects of having to drink contaminated water, and the potential health effects of consuming contaminated water. IBM and the Regional Board argue that they meet and exceed current health standards.
        * Petitioners also argue that the State Board should consider the “factor of uncertainty” and the “poor state of current medical knowledge” regarding chronic and synergistic effects of contaminants. They argue that non-degradation should be applied. IBM and the Regional Board counter that the Board should accept existing standards and claim they’ve met those standards.
        * The State Board offered a compromise: existing levels detected are of no concern, but higher levels may be. The board proposed additional monitoring because they believed the program did not comprehend “the full toxic contamination of the area had been defined or contained.”
    * 1989 *Silicon Valley Toxics News*
        * “Mt. View Sites May Take 300 Years to Clean Up”
            - Hundreds of residents showed up for a public informational session on EPA superfund sites in Mt. View.
            - The sites are known as MEW (bounded by Middlefield, Ellis, Whisman)
            - The sites are “the worst in the valley. There are more chemicals in higher concentrations that have spread farther and longer than any other site in the valley and may take three hundred years to clean up.”
            - The Moffett Field NAS was the most prolific, with nineteen different sites identified as Superfund.
            - The MEW area is owned or operated by twenty companies, including Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel Corporation, and Raytheon Company.
            - The contamination plume extends nearly 2 miles long, 1/2 mile wide, and 500 feet deep.
            - Around 70 different chemicals have been spilled, including 6 identified as carcinogens under Prop 65 (arsenic, lead, cadmium, chloroform, TCE, and vinyl chloride).
            - Estimates of cleanup range widely: deep aquifers may return to safe levels in 2-45 years; shallow aquifers may return to safe levels in 46-300 years; soils inside slurry walls from 3,6 years; soils outside slurry walls 1-6 years.
            - Companies ague that it is not “cost-effective” to clean up beyond 96%; the estimated cost of cleanup is as much as $600 million. “We don’t feel that cost should be a factor when looking at making companies responsible for the mess they have made of one of our county’s greatest natural resources—its groundwater supply.”
            - The well located near the plume has not been contaminated.
        * “Future Leaks Grow—Total Is Now 847”
            - 847 fuel leaks identified by the Santa Clara Valley Water District and Regional Water Quality Control Board in 1988
        * “Underground Tank Leaks May Cost 37.5 Billion to Clean Up”
            - A study by the firm Harding Associates in August 3, 1988, found that it will cost #37.5 billion to clean up underground tanks across the US.
        * “IBM Appeals RWQCB Order”
            - The RWQCB adopted a long-range cleanup plan on October 19, 1989, despite objections by IBM, the Santa Clara County Manufacturing Group, and the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition. IBM objected to requirement of extraction at Edenvale Gap to prevent migration of the plume. SVTC objected that IBM should meet more stringent cleanup requirements (the IBM plume is up to five miles long, the largest in the Valley). IBM says it has spent up to $42 million on cleanup already.
* EPA Environmental News, "New Contamination Found in Mountain View's Deep Wells"
    * Deep aquifer in Mt. View is discovered leaking by deep monitoring wells below shallow groundwater contamination. The wells draw on aquifers that public wells draw on, but the EPA reports that no contamination was discovered at the wells. (1)
    * “This incident is important because this is the first time contamination has been detected at these depths in this part of the Santa Clara Valley.” (1)
    * The EPA suggests that the water was contaminated by abandoned wells that provided a “conduit” between the clay layers. (1)
    * Contamination was discovered at the MEW Industrial Park in summer of 1981 that included TCE, TCA, DCE, and DCA found in shallow groundwater between 300 and 1,000 ppm. (1)
    * The city of Mountain View found no contamination of public wells in the area; private wells have likely been affected but are no longer used. (2)
    * Three companies (Fairchild, Intel, and Raytheon) are conducting an investigation under EPA supervision. (2)
    * There are nearly 500 monitoring wells drilled at the MEW site. (2)
    * Ongoing actions for cleanup include: removal of underground tanks and vaults where leaks were found; removal of contaminated soil; removal of buildings where leaks occurred; sealing utility tunnels and storm sumps; drilling extraction wells to remove contaminated water; installation of carbon absorption systems to treat water being extracted before discharged to sewers.

    * "More Wells Fouled"
        * Paper reports that the number of contaminated wells has risen in three years, from 19 to 46.
        * There are as many as 100 operating and abandoned manufacturing plants that are leaching chemicals.
        * “In most cases, the chemicals have leaked from underground chemical waste storage tanks and plumbing that cracked, rusted out or otherwise failed.”
        * Ted Smith argues that the reason so many more wells are contaminated is because the regulatory agency—San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board—is understaffed and unable to supervise the cleanup, allowing industry to do the minimal amount of work.
        * The rise in the number of contaminated wells may not be because the chemicals are spreading, but that the rise can be attributed to more scrutiny.
        * Since the mid-1980s, companies have removed 83 underground tanks, 30,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil, seven piping systems, and one concrete vault.
        * Scott Yoo—water quality manager for San Jose Water Company
        * By 1987 only four sites were fully contained (out of 19 Superfund sites), overseen by IBM (south San Jose), Fairchild (south San Jose), Van Waters & Rogers (south San Jose), and Applied Materials (Santa Clara)

    * "Put toxics in their place"
        * The Tanner Act of 1986 makes it illegal to dump toxic wastes on California land
        * No longer, then, can toxic wastes be dumped in landfills.
        * There are critics concerned that the Tanner bill, interpreted by the state Department of Health Services, may dictate too much to local governments.
