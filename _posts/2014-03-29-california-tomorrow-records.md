Scope and Content
-----------------

The records of California Tomorrow document the organization's growth and influence from its initial meeting in 1961 through its dissolution in the spring of 1983. Linking the objectives of conservationists, planners, regulators and California residents, California Tomorrow called for comprehensive state planning to address challenges faced by the state such as sustainable land use, both for agriculture and housing; conservation of water and energy resources; preservation of California's coastline, deserts, lakes and forests; transportation planning; and regional government. Their activities included the publication of reports and the journal Cry California, and the creation of the comprehensive The California Tomorrow Plan, which was born from Town Hall meetings throughout the state. Records contain minutes of meetings, correspondence, speeches and the personal files of founder Alfred Heller and co-founder Samuel Wood, with the bulk of the material consisting of editorial files for the organization's journal. Contents of the editorial files include the correspondence of William Bronson, first editor, and John W. Abbott, who succeeded him, and files for each individual issue, containing rough drafts, photographs, drawings, correspondence and notes. Also includes the working files and edited draft versions of The California Tomorrow Plan, beginning with the "A First Sketch" of 1971, with comments solicited from manuscript reviewers and the public as well as press notices following publication. Administrative material in the collection includes reference files, maps, scrapbooks and clippings, membership files, publication sales and distribution information, and financial records. The records also contain government reports and studies, as well as notes and correspondence from study tours, conferences, seminars and regional meetings sponsored by California Tomorrow and other organizations, with some accompanying audiocassette and audiotape recordings.

Series 1, Founder and Co-founder Files, contains the individual and shared files of Alfred E. Heller and Samuel E. Wood. These include California Tomorrow administrative material from the organization's inception, as well as meeting minutes and correspondence with Advisory Board members and the Board of Directors. Also contains material related to the many appearances made by Heller and Wood on behalf of California Tomorrow at conferences and seminars. Alfred Heller maintained his own subject files, and Samuel Wood's papers include the subject and job files he brought with him to California Tomorrow as well as his annual appointment calendars.

Series 2, Administrative Files, contains correspondence with the Board of Directors and meeting minutes, along with correspondence of a general nature with California Tomorrow members and prospective members. Also includes the files of John W. Abbott, who served as executive secretary in addition to becoming editor of Cry California following the departure of William Bronson. The Organizational History subseries contains the ongoing project files of Isabel Wade, who was executive director of California Tomorrow at the time of its demise in 1983. Contains material regarding all aspects of membership services, including the study tours sponsored by California Tomorrow, brochures and fundraising appeals, grant applications and promotional material. Also includes files documenting office operations, including dissemination of publications, job descriptions, financial information and receipts, in addition to shared reference material and photograph and subject files.

Series 3, Publications, includes a copy of every publication produced by California Tomorrow, and a full run of the journal Cry California with accompanying editorial material. These files include many remarkable black and white photographic prints primarily of the California landscape, but also many other subjects, along with contact sheets and other graphics material. This series also includes the correspondence of editor William Bronson and material regarding the publication of The California Tomorrow Plan by William Kaufmann, Inc.

Series 4, The California Tomorrow Plan, documents this groundbreaking project from the planning stages through the "A First Sketch" presentation, the subsequent revision process, and final publication, presentation, and reactions from the public, press, and professionals in many fields.

Series 5, California 2000 Project, documents the final undertaking of California Tomorrow, a study outlining the challenges and opportunities facing the state in the last two decades before the millennium. Specific areas include population, land, water, energy, and air.

Series 6, Conferences, contains material from the many seminars sponsored by California Tomorrow as well as those of other professional organizations and advocacy groups. California Tomorrow conferences provided a forum for communication between the public and experts in the fields of conservation and planning and related fields such as architecture. Files include correspondence, photographs, audiorecordings and transcripts of speeches and remarks, when available, as well as any brochures, background printed materials and comments from participants. The files also document the many conferences and seminars attended by Alfred Heller, Samuel Wood, and John Abbott on behalf of California Tomorrow, including correspondence, notes and background materials.

History of California Tomorrow
------------------------------

The history below is from the [finding aid](http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt92903742/entire_text/).

### Organizational History

California Tomorrow, a nonprofit educational organization, was founded by Alfred E. Heller and Samuel E. Wood. The first meeting was held on June 24, 1961, with Alfred E. Heller named president, William M. Roth, vice-president, and Harold Berliner secretary; Samuel E. Wood became executive director. The founding members' intent was to link the objectives of conservationists, planners, and regulators and to urge the adoption of a widely integrated planning process to meet the needs of both conservation and growth.

On Sept 16, 1961, the following Statement of Principles was adopted by the Advisory Board:

> That our use of these resources should derive not from whim, but from careful determination of how we believe we should live our lives, now and in the future, and how we believe a healthy economy can be maintained;
>
> That individual gain is not alone sufficient reason for committing natural resources to use, but that the greatest good to be gained by the greatest number in the long run should be the controlling consideration in resources policy-making, both private and public;
>
> That the work and activities of man should and can be so ordered that all citizens of the state may continually enjoy the widest variety of choice of environment, including quiet and light, pure air and water, and a fair share of untrammeled green earth;

The group recruited many well-known members for its Advisory Board, including Wallace Stegner, architect Nathaniel Owings, San Diego writer Neil Morgan, Caspar Weinberger, Standish Backus, Jr., Victor H. Palmieri, and Simon Eisner, Pasadena city planner. Assemblyman Willie Brown, Jr., and Harvey S. Perloff, Dean of the UCLA School of Architecture, joined the Advisory Board in later years. In their public debut, with a 63-page booklet entitled California Going, Going..., Heller and Wood sounded an alarm about the dangerous consequences of unplanned growth on the environment and future quality of life in the Golden State. At a time when California was attracting 1,500 new residents each day, they called for coordinated and comprehensive planning efforts between the public and private spheres to "keep California beautiful and productive." A quarterly journal, Cry California, was launched in late 1965, initially edited by William Bronson. It earned a solid reputation amongst the environmental press for introducing new topics and exploring complicated issues.

However, the organization is perhaps best known for The California Tomorrow Plan of 1972, which offered an alternative model for dealing with the challenges facing the state in a systematic way. A series of statewide seminars brought together members of the public and experts in the fields of planning, conservation and government to identify specific regional concerns and exchange ideas to address them, which were incorporated into The California Tomorrow Plan. This format proved so successful that it was also employed in preparing the 1982 publication, California 2000: The Next Frontier.

Faced with declining membership and financial problems along with a marked change in political climate that affected grant funding, by the end of 1982 California Tomorrow was in a precarious situation. In April and May of 1983, members of the Advisory Board and Board of Directors were requested to submit their resignations and California Tomorrow's activities were suspended. A restructured organization with a different focus was established in 1984.

### Biographies of Co-Founders

[Alfred E. Heller](), founder and president of California Tomorrow from 1961-1974, is a California native and graduate of Stanford University. He was living in Nevada City and publishing the weekly Nevada County Nugget when he became involved in a grassroots attempt to reroute new freeway construction slated to go through the middle of town. Subsequently he became a member of the California State Highway Commission. His experience with various state agencies during the freeway campaign convinced him that the lack of integrated planning in California posed a serious threat to the state's future. In addition to numerous articles on environmental problems, Heller co-authored California Going, Going... and Phantom Cities of California as well as editing The California Tomorrow Plan.

[Samuel E. Wood](), co-founder and executive director of California Tomorrow from 1961-1968, was a former official of the United States Agriculture and Interior departments and staff director of California legislative committees in conservation fields. He was instrumental in drawing up the 1959 bill that established the State Office of Planning and required the preparation of a state development plan. After leaving the state government service, Wood worked as a planning consultant and political science professor in Sacramento. He was introduced to Alfred Heller through a mutual friend, Catherine Bauer Wurster, professor at the University of California, Berkeley in the Department of City and Regional Planning. She recognized their shared commitment to arousing awareness regarding the need for comprehensive planning and also appreciated their complementary talents. Dr. Wood provided the research for the publications California Going, Going... and Phantom Cities of California. He continued as a consultant with California Tomorrow following his retirement as executive director in 1968.
