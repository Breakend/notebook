> Donald T. Carlson Papers (SC0539). Department of Special Collections and University Archives, Stanford University Libraries, Stanford, Calif.

Notes
-----

Looked at Box 1 and Box 2 on 2013-12-06. Much of the material revolves around
internal Stanford business, and little with the university's outside
relationships with Palo Alto and surrounding communities. I suspect most of
these records are in the Sterling Papers.
