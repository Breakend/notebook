"The emergence of Silicon Valley and Route 128 represented a new kind of regional economic development. The geography of older industrial complexes had been determined largely by the availability of disciplined labor and proximity to raw materials, energy supplies, and markets. The source of growth in Silicon Valley and Route 128, however, was knowledge. Organized research had created new knowledge, which was then turned into commercial products." (p. 2)

"[Technopolises] Each has its own distinctive educational, cultural, and business institutions. Most importantly, each technopolis has a core technology or set of technologies. This specialized nature of technopolises explains the differences among high-technology regions in responding to global economic and technological change." (p. 5)
