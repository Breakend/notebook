**Karl J. Belser, *Planning Progress 1956* (San Jose: County of Santa Clara Planning Commission, July 1956)**

p. 1: "Hammer in hand, the county went noisily about the job of transforming
itself from a rural to a metropolitan community. Bulldozers leveled orchards
for thousands of homesites. The steel webbing of new factories spread over
former hay fields. Acres of asphalt marked the parking areas of new suburban
shopping centers. Service stations sprang up like mushrooms along our major
thoroughfares. Fleets of ready-mix trucks disgorged concrete into the
foundation forms of every kind of building -- in every part of the county."

p. 1: Industry was the catalyst of change. Belser notes that 134 new plants
located in Santa Clara County in the past five years, employing 10,762
workers. The Ford Plant in Milpitas, opened in May 17, 1955, was among the
largest, creating 540 new cars per day. Another 35 industries settled in the
county in 1954, spending $14.5 million in capital outlay; 89 industries spent
\$5.5 million to expand facilities. 26 of the nation's 500 largest industrial
firms had built plants in the county in 1955.

p. 1: Belser anticipates 63,000 to 105,000 new people who will come to work
for the announced construction of IBM's research center, the Lockheed facility
near Moffett Field, and a General Motors assembly plant near Sunnyvale.

p. 2: Belser predicts that, with new industry and the "attractions of a mild
climate and pleasant living conditions," the population of the county could
reach one million by 1970. Previously, county planners predicted the
population could reach one million in 1990. He is basing this estimate on a
population estimate by the California Taxpayers' Association, which counted
403,900 in 1955 and 456,800 in 1956 --- the county gained 52,900 people in a
single year, or averaging 4,400 people a month.

p. 2: Belser notes potential conflict:

> Old residents view the county's frenzied growth with mixed emotions. Some
> see this growth as "progress", a condition implying speculative opportunity
> or reflected economic benefits. The farmer views with alarm the
> disappearance of the county's farmlands under the onslaught of urbanization.
> The suburbanite sees his "country living" threatened by the spread of the
> solid city. Some people are inclined to welcome newcomers to the valley,
> remembering their own delight in its attractions. Others fear the blighting
> effects of smog and traffic congestion which come with concentrations of
> people. Some are glad for the boom in the building industry. Others look at
> our sprawling, rubber stamp subdivisions and wonder if these are "the slums
> of tomorrow." Some hail the increase in assessed valuation brought by new
> investment. Others are staggered by the prospects of increased taxes for new
> schools, larger capacity sewers, flood control works, parks and recreation,
> and other public services.

p. 4: Four branches of county government are involved in planning: The Board
of Supervisors; the Planning Commission; the County Executive; and the
Planning Department.

p. 5: Members of the commission:

* [Weller Curtner]()
* [Will Weston]()
* [Charles Kuhn]()
* [Carroll Wentz]()
* [Chester Root]()
* [Christian Wilder]()
* [Robert Welch]()
* [Sal Ruiz]()

p. 8: "the choice is between a planned or an unplanned environment. We can
have a hodge-podge growth in which decay is built in; or we can have a
planned, orderly growth in which the needs of a million people have been
adequately foreseen."

The report lays out these general goals for the general plan:

   * *economic efficiency and well-being* ("preservation of agriculture and
   related industry"; "preservation of adequate amounts of prime industrial
   areas from the intermixing of conflicting uses"; "extension of utilities
   and community services"; "adequate commercial facilities located and
   designed for maximum convenience and function"; "a system for transporting
   people and goods within the county and the Bay Area") (p. 11)
   * *the establishment of balanced communities, offerings* ("a separate and
   distinct community identity for groups of neighborhoods"; "separation from
   neighboring communities by major arterials, topographic barriers or
   greenbelts of open space"; "employment opportunities close to residential
   areas"; "modulated residential densities for a variety of family types";
   shopping and professional services located for convenient and safe use")
   (p. 12)
   * *the establishment of new neighborhoods and the conservation and renewal
   of older neighborhoods to provide, according to plan* ("adequate living
   conditions; protection from through-traffic; elementary schools; centrally
   located shopping facilities; space for recreation; stability of investment
   and character of new and existing neighborhoods") (p. 12)
   * *preservation of scenic beauty and recreational features* ("open space
   (mountain areas, farmlands and orchards, streamsides, waterways) preserved
   as relief from concentrated urban development"; "preservation and
   acquisition of areas of natural recreation potential in proper size and
   location to anticipate the demands and needs of future populations";
   "scenic roads and regional recreation highways protected from unsightly
   development, landscaped and planted for visual amenity") (p. 12)
   * *conservation of the resources of the county for the benefits of future
   generations* ("protection of life, health, and safety; preservation of
   cultural achievements; fostering of cultural aspirations and education";
   "protection of our best soils from erosion by natural forces or premature
   urbanization"; "protection of reservoirs and mountain watershed areas for
   the collection of water; protection of areas suitable for percolation of
   water to underground aquifers; protection of the quality of water, whether
   local in origin or imported"; "prevention of the pollution of air by
   planned location and control of all contributing causes"; "protection of
   industries based on the natural resources of the county such as
   agriculture, mining and salt extraction") (p. 14)
   * *integration of county development with private, city, regional, state
   and federal planning programs* (p. 14)

p. 19: "Planning for Santa Clara County is like running a race for tremendous
stakes. If we win the race, our reward is a well-planned environment in a
region rich in all the resources for pleasant living; a mild climate, scenic
beauty, fertile soil and a prosperous economy. If we lose the race, our lot
will be an anarchy of haphazard development."

p. 47: Some 1,000 acres were brought under greenbelt zoning between 1953 and
1954, but expanding muncipalities still threatened to annex greenbelts. This
was the case with the "Dana Greenbelt" along Old San Francisco Road south of
Sunnyvale. Orchardists in the middle of the 550-acre area suddenly became part
of the city. Such developments led to farmers lobbying for [Assembly Bill
2166](), introduced by [Bruce Allen]() in 1955, made greenbelts inviolate
against annexation. By May 1956, 4,021 acres of farmland were adopted as
exclusive agricultural districts. Another 7,000 acres were in the process of
final adoption.
