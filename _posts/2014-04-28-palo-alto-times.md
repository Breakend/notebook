## January

**January 28**

* "Electronics research plant planned for foothills area"
    * General Telephone and Electronics Laboratories Corporation purchased 75
    acres to build a research facility alongside Arastradero Road near Page Mill
    Road.
    * "The land involved lies within the city limits of Palo Alto to the north
    of Page Mill Road and apparently is part of a large property development in
    the foothills." (1)
    * The Palo Alto site was selected "because of its location in a rapidly
    growing electronics research area and because of its proximity to Sylvania
    Electric Products, Incorporated, both owned by General Telephone. Sylvania
    is in Mountain View and Lenkurt is in San Carlos." (1)
    * "He stated the facility, located in the foothills northwest of Stanford
    University, would be used primarily for pure scientific research rather than
    for work on specific projects in the fields of communication and
    electronics. Some military research might be conducted at the new plant,
    [Donald C.] Power said, but he predicted none of the highly classified
    military work now being done at Sylvania would be moved to the Palo Alto
    installation." (1)
        * Donald Power is the chairman of the board for GT&E. GT&E is a wholly
        owned subsidiary of General Telephone and Electronics Corporation.
    * No information about the size of the plant, number of employees, or time
    schedule for completion was disclosed.

**January 29**

* "103-acre foothill plan told"
    * An announcement for a 103-acre plan in the Palo Alto-Los Altos Hills
    foothills for proposed rustic shopping center and luxury homes development.
    The announcement comes a day after the GT&E announcement of foothills
    development. The GT&E site is a quarter mile away from this 103-acre site.
    (1)
    * "Also nearby, in the Stanford Garden Industrial Park, is an 80-acre site
    where Ampex Corporation recently announced plans to build a new
    headquarters." (1)
    * "A major obstacle to development of a portion of the 103-acre site
    purchased by Hoffman for a shopping center is the exclusively residential
    zoning requirements of Los Altos Hills." (1)
        * This seems key to a lot of the foothills development. Most of it seems
        zoned for residential or agricultural development, but these
        encroachments of industrial and commercial facilities is shaping
        resident responses to foothills development.
    * To alleviate concerns, developers say that the only commercial development
    will occur in the 15 acres next to the proposed Junipero Serra Freeway; the
    remainder of the property will be used for luxury homes on sites of one
    acre. (1-2)
    * "The property in question has been known as the Lawrence Balari farm and
    has been used for horsebreeding." (2)
        * NB: loss of ag land.
    * Palo Alto officials claim they had no advance knowledge of GT&E's proposal
    to build "a 'campus style' research center" in the foothills. Some officials
    opposed rezoning. Planning commissioner Kay Towle, chairman of the
    commission, opposed rezoning for non-residential development. Edward
    Arbuckle, another commissioner, felt the city should set a balance between
    industrial and residential zoning: "We have to take a long look at our
    community and what we desire to have here," he said. (2)
    * City manager Jerry Keithley was approached from an anonymous firm about
    building a campus-style facility in Palo Alto, and he surmised that GT&E was
    the firm that approached him. But he notes the city made no commitment to
    rezone the land, but says the firm is "entitled to consideration." (2)

## February

**February 9**

* "Residents hit foothill development"
    * A protest movement is organized to oppose foothills development by Ampex
    Corporation.
    * The first meeting of the group was held on the morning of February 9 at
    the home of Mrs. Karl Spangenberg (21000 Page Mill Rd.) and another meeting
    was scheduled for Friday 8pm at the Los Altos Hills Town Hall.
    * Mrs. Spangenberg serves as the group's spokesperson.
    * Alf Brandin, Stanford's vice president in charge of land development, said
    he did "not quite understand what the people fear." (1)
    * Mrs. Spangenberg: "Palo Alto wants money. Stanford wants money. They are
    willing to sacrifice all the beauty of these hills for money." (1)
    * The group is especially concerned about the Ampex development, and
    concerned about industrialization generally. (1)
    * The group anticipates support from lowlands residents concerned over the
    loss of the beauty of the foothills. (1)
    * Dr. Harold Beaver, another spokesperson: "We're all just going to have to
    get together to have an industrial plant right out there where everyone can
    see it." (1)

**February 10**

* "Stanford foothills plans hit by Hills"
    * In a letter to Alf Brandin, Los Altos Hills officials accused Stanford of
    "jeopardizing existing zoning and land development all along its boundaries"
    and charged that Stanford was the "only jurisdiction in our area whose plans
    and actions, in their development stages, are not subject to public
    scrutiny." (1)
    * The letter was signed by Major John Fowle and three other officials from
    Los Altos Hills. (1)
    * The letter criticized plans for Ampex, but generally opposed plans to
    develop industry in the foothills. (1)
    * The letter notes that Stanford has changed course; since 1953 the number
    of acres earmarked for industry grew from 50 acres to 2,300 acres.
    * The letter charged: "You did not tell us what fresh planning the
    university has done in the light of this enormously increased plan for
    factory development to provide for traffic, or even to study where factory
    workers in the new plants will live." (2)
    * Their concerns centered around access and land destruction: Los Altos
    Hills officials were concerned about the potential for 20,000 workers coming
    and going between shifts, and noted that "the Ampex and similar foothill
    industrial sites will require high capacity access roads" and "drastic
    bulldozing" of areas to accommodate construction. (2)
    * The letter charged: "We were left with the impression that the university
    has found it more expedient and more profitable to lease its lands to
    industry . . . The foothill lands of Stanford University comprise perhaps
    the most beautiful undeveloped area remaining on the Peninsula." (2)

**February 11**

* Stanford's pastoral lands hum with research work
* Stanford academic lands provide home for host of projects
* "Decision now will determine future"
    * Editorial of the *Times*
    * The *Times* notes the land is Stanford land zoned for agricultural use;
    before anything could be built "hearings would have to be held and the
    property rezoned." (16)
    * "If established procedure is followed, Stanford would annex the proposed
    Ampex site to Palo Alto, which then would proceed with the change in zoning
    The General Telephone site already is in the city, and thus the established
    rezoning procedure would be followed. As a result, the planning commission
    and the city council of Palo Alto will have an important decision to make
    when these proposals go before them. Their decisions on these projects will
    set the precedent for future proposals, and may well determine what the
    foothills area will look like." (16)
    * "We would be sorry to see those foothills turned into industrial areas,
    even for industries as attractive as the research plants that are going
    up--buildings and groups, we might point out, which often are more
    attractive than some commercial and even residential areas. There is no
    question that these industries require large parking lots and would need
    roads beyond what are available now. The traffic from them would compound
    the difficulties already being experienced in the foothills area." (16)
    * "Yet there's no question in our minds that attractive industry of this
    kind in the area is needed. We already make high demands on our municipal
    and school governments for services, and we cannot expect to pay for those
    services unless we get businesses and industries to bear a heavy share of
    the taxes. In the future, our people will make even greater demands on
    government, and thus a tax base that includes these industries will be an
    even greater asset." (16)
        * An argument that business will benefit the tax base, and thus
        residents.
    * "The issue, we believe, is not whether we need more industry or not. It is
    whether we need it in the foothills area." (16)
    * "If we need it there, we should make the decision with our eyes wide
    open." (16)
    * "...we believe it would be valuable for our planners to take a
    comprehensive look at the whole foothills area, as it is today and as we
    want it to be 10 or 20 years from now. On this broad view, Palo Alto should
    decide what zoning it wants, and then stick to it. That decision, however,
    should take into consideration the desires of the people adjacent to the
    areas involved--in Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Portola Valley and Woodside." (16)
    * "Many of the people in those communities built their homes there because
    they wanted a measure of rural living, some protection from 'city' life. Any
    planning should be done with the cooperation of their planning commissioners
    or other city officials." (16)

    * The last general plan was created in 1955.
    * The commission sees a need to update, especially in the face of new
    proposals for baylands and foothills development.
    * The original 1955 plan underestimated the population; the plan anticipated
    20 workers per acre in the Stanford Industrial Park, but the actual figure
     became 75 workers per acre.
    * Debate over whether they should pursue apartments for denser populations;
    Commissioner Edward Arbuckle questioned whether the "residential character"
    should be changed and argued the city was attractive because of its
    residential atmosphere.

    * Editorial by Mrs. W. A. Watterud
    * She writes that Councilman Navis spoke of a need for a new master plan
    with regard to the foothills, but then said he wouldn't wait for the new
    plan to approve lands for Ampex and General Telephone.
    * The editorial criticizes this; she argues that once the industrial plants
    are in place, the whole area will be industrial. The land that is bulldozed
    out will become fill for the baylands, she argues.

**March 4**

* Speed building of court here, jurors urge, p. 17
* 13 residents protest foothill zoning change, p. 17
    * Residents submitted a protest to the Santa Clara County supervisors
    against efforts to rezone the foothills for industry.
    * Signers of the telegram were Mr. and Mrs. William A. Watterud (see the
    editorial above "Fill for the Baylands"); Peter Hughes; Les and Agnes
    Helgesson; Mr. and Mrs. Robert N. Boesel; Mr. and Mrs. George T. Hayes; Kent
    and Mary Bourquin; Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Mohr. (17)
    * The week before according to the article, 78 residents, all Stanford
    alumni, protested to the university in an advertisement in the Palo Alto
    Times and charged that the university revealed no plans for development
    until the Times exposed the story. (17)
* Crucial decisions facing us now, p. 18
    * Editorial of the Times.
    * Notes Stanford has a "leading role in determining the development of our
    communities" because of its large holdings of undeveloped land. HOwever,
    "Stanford lands also affect other nearby property; and, we ought to point
    out, in some areas of the foothills region the strict residential zoning
    already has yielded to commercial uses." (18)
    * "Each of the news stories seems to indicate that the walls against
    commercial and industrial uses in the foothills area are crumbling; or at
    least that they are being challenged." (18)
    * The Times argues that three major issues have changed thinking about the
    foothills: 1) Junipero Serra Boulevard; 2) economic considerations (rising
    cost of land); 3) pressure of business and industry. (18)
    * Junipero Serra Boulevard expected to become an eight-lane freeway. The
    Times notes that residences are hesitant to build near a freeway, but
    businesses welcome it because it provides transportation for workers and
    products. (18)
    * The rising cost of land means its less economically viable to build
    residences on large lots. Since developers cannot recoup their investments
    with single-family homes, commercial development becomes more attractive.
    (18)
    * Businesses want to build, and the city wants businesses because of the tax
    base they provide. Businesses help support the municipal infrastructure.
    (18)
    * The Times argues that "we're fortunate": "Our industries are a far cry
    from the factories we usually associate with industry and commerce." By way
    of example, the Times points to *Sunset* magazine, which considered moving
    to the foothills if Willow Road is widened. "We would find it difficult  to
    find many objections to Sunset as a neighbor." They also point to General
    Telephone, and anticipates "beautifully designed buildings, landscaped
    surroundings, and most of the 77 acres left in their natural state."
    Furthermore, General Telephone expects to ask for planned community zoning
    rather than industrial, so as to allow Palo Alto strict control over land
    use and architecture. (18)
    * "To realize how fortunate we are in the development we are getting, all we
    have to do is drive through the industrial and commercial sections and
    compare them with similar areas elsewhere." (18)
    * "We have just realized that the inevitable changes are upon us, and while
    we can't hold them back, we should try to guide them into channels which
    will be best for the entire area. . . . [the foothills] should not be laid
    bare, nor should they be leveled. To protect the land and the people in the
    surrounding areas there is a desperate need for cooperation and planning."
    (18)
* (full page on Stanford lands, p. 19)
    * The articles here include "Undeveloped acres prime resource," "Stanford
    answers questions about plans for industrial development in foothill area,"
    "Stanford wouldn't do 'anything detrimental'," and "Land 'ripe' for
    condemnation by governmental units."
* Undeveloped acres prime resource, p. 19
    * Alf Brandin: "we're not in the land development business per se--we're in
    the business of education. But we're doing everything we possibly can to
    produce income [to support education]." (19)
* "Stanford answers questions about plans for industrial development in foothill
area," p. 19
    * The Times submitted a list of questions to Stanford to answer about the
    proposed development plans in the foothills.
        1. "In brief, what are Stanford's long range land development plans for
           the university-owned acreage?"
            * "Approximately 420 acres have already been leased for residential,
            commercial, professional and light industrial uses. It is the
            university's present plan to develop the remaining 3,680 acres for
            similar usage, if not required for educational use." (19)
        2. "Why is it necessary to open up foothills lands for light industry?"
            * Stanford provides five reasons: 1) Provide direct benefits to
            academic programs; 2) provide a natural environment and isolation
            which industries want for their scientists and engineers; 3) provide
            a broader tax base; 4) provide the type of development that can
            "take advantage of and preserve the natural beauty of the lands"
            because such development "can be planned to avoid much of the mass
            benching, cutting and filling required by other types of
            developments, such as single family residential."; 5) Provide the
            university with a larger income that can benefit educational
            programs.
        3. "When and why were earlier plans for residential development
           dropped?"
            * Stanford offers four explanations: 1) Increasing certainty of an
            eight-lane freeway through the foothills; 2) presence of a freeway
            provides immediate access for industrial plants; 3) research and
            development oriented companies were showing preference for
            development of sites in the hills rather than on level land; 4)
            enough demand for light industry in the area that it became evident
            the industrial park would not serve long-range needs.
        4. "Where will the personnel working at the foothill industrial plants
           live?"
            * "The Junipero Serra Freeway and other highways in the planning
            stage will bring foothill industry sites within easy commuting
            distance of many communities." (19)
        5. "What new roads will have to be built to serve the foothill
           industrial area?"
            * "New internal circulation roads will have to be built by Stanford
            to serve the particular area being developed." (19)
        6. "To what extent will existing roads have to be improved to serve the
           expanded Industrial Park?"
            * Improvements to Page Mill, Junipero Serra, and Arastradero are
            being studied by the Palo Alto city council and Santa Clara County
            planning commission; the timing of these improvements is "being
            carefully coordinated by city and county officials, working with the
            university and major lesees." (19)
        7. "Does Stanford plan to share in the cost of road improvements?"
        8. "What standards will be set up for industrial construction and types
           of industry allowed in the foothills?"
            * "Will the foothills be leveled?" Stanford says they will not be,
            and that the natural contours will be preserved as close as
            possible.
            * "How many stories may buildings be constructed?" Foothill
            developments plan for one and two story buildings.
            * "What are the university's plans to make the parking lots
            attractive?" The university is requiring screen and landscape
            parking areas.
        9. "What is Stanford's plan to discuss the total foothill land
           development program with affected nearby communities?"
            * "The university has always worked closely with officials of
            communities to which the developed areas are annexed. In addition,
            the university has reviewed its planning with all communities on its
            perimeter, as well as with both county and state officials, and it
            will continue to do so." (19)
* Land 'ripe' for condemnation by governmental unit, p. 19
* Stanford wouldn't do 'anything detrimental', p. 19
    * Alf Brandin: "We have just as much concern as to what is contiguous to
    industrial property as the residents of this area. Stanford is trying to be
    an enlightened developer, and we wouldn't want to do anything detrimental to
    this community." (19)
    * Brandin: "People should feel thankful Stanford owns the land, and not
    someone else. We try and look at the problems politically, sociologically,
    aesthetically and economically." (19)
    * Brandin notes that Stanford often meets with officials in Palo Alto and
    Menlo Park at the staff level. He also notes that Stanford had a master plan
    before Lost Altos Hills was even a city, and "not once did they ever come to
    see us about the road systems." (19)
    * Brandin: "they're [sic] aren't any of us who wouldn't like to see the
    lands left open. But we have to develop lands, and for two reasons: Taxes
    and the high cost of education." (19)
    * According to Brandin, the Stanford Board of Trustees voted to rezone the
    foothills to industrial at their meeting Nov. 15, 1956. (19)
    * Brandin notes that changing the plans was in response to freeway
    construction.
        * Brandin: "Look at the developments that are adjacent to the Bayshore
        and the Nimitz freeways. We know we can't put $40,000 to $80,000 houses
        there. We've changed (our plans) here, and we've tried to make the
        changes years ahead. This area is right next to an eight-lane freeway."
    * Stanford is fighting back here -- noting that residents in Los Altos and
    Los Altos Hills cause just as much traffic congestion as industrial traffic;
    noting that building sites will be regulated to preserve open space; noting
    that Stanford has helped build roads such as Page Mill. (19)
        * Stanford is attempting to make a case for itself repeatedly in the
        newspapers -- that without Stanford, none of this would be here?

    * This is the same group that ran two advertisements in the Times
    questioning Stanford's plans for the foothills.
    * Mahan: "Although we are opposed to industry in the foothills at this time,
    our long-range aim is to work with Stanford and neighboring communities to
    develop a plan that will be acceptable to all parties." (1)

    (secretary-treasurer); Mrs. Spangenberg, William Greer, Russell Tinkham, and

    * The Stanford Board of Trustees received around 250 letters concerning the
    university's policy on industrial development, the majority of which opposed
    the plans and were clipped from the Times ad.
    * Mahan called on Palo Alto Mayor Noel E. Porter to disqualify himself from
    industrial zoning or annexation because of his position as vice president of
    Hewlett-Packard Company.
        * Mahan: "Under the circumstances, I don't see how Mr. Porter can be
        objective." (1)

    planning in addition to counties published borchures") and his 25-person
    staff. (18)
    * "Ample space for industry on flat lands has been allocated without the
    necessity of extending such uses in to the foothills." (18)
    * "Large scale factory or mass production should not be developed in the
    foothills anywhere." He offers these reasons:
        1) "Greatly increased traffic flow through residential neighborhoods,
           smog, noise, danger."
        2) "Extensive cuts and fills required by large scale building and even
           larger parking lots."
        3) "Trucking of incoming raw materials and outgoing finished products."
        4) "Low gradient roads, with severe cuts and fills, required for the
           trucks."
        5) "Serious loss of rain water through run-off."
        6) "Irreparable damage to natural beauty."
    * "Stanford University is so highly valued and such an integral part of this
    community that no one could possibly wish to obstruct its future. But only
    regional planning holds the answer for the area of which the Stanford lands
    are the very heart."

    * The Citizens Committee on Regional Planning responds to a series of
    questions asked of Stanford in the Times. Robert Mahan issued a statement
    in response, issuing responses for each question.
    * Stanford argues that there will not be serious cutting of the foothills,
    but Mahan responds that “There is no possible way to put industry into the
    foothills without bulldozing tremendous flat pads for parking and for
    building sites.” (7)
    * Stanford argues the foothills will not be leveled, but Mahan points out
    a previous column with Alf Brandin who noted Stanford was permitting 20%
    of land for buildings and 40% for parking. “This could mean that 60 per
    cent of a foothill site would be bulldozed flat. This seems to contradict
    the university’s statement to the Times on the same day that the foothills
    will not be leveled.” (7)
    * Mahan criticizes Stanford’s claim about meeting with city leaders. The
    problem as Mahan sees it is not that these meetings are happening, but
    that they’re happening without “the press and public present.” (7)

I, myself, am confident that thoughtful and skilled planning not tied to the single criterion of financial gain to Stanford can produce something more imaginative and noteworthy than a manufacturing plant and a motel.”

	*	The Planning Commissioned recommend new restrictive industrial zoning of the 254-acre foothill annexation, but proposed a new site for the Ampex plant and recommended agricultural-conservation zoning for 80 acres along Arastradero Road originally proposed for Ampex.
	*	The Commission suggested a site near Page Mill Road and Junipero Serra Boulevard would be more desirable for Ampex. The new site would place the research facility facing the present industrial park and over the hill from Los Altos Hills residents.
	*	The commission favored an LM-5 zoning (limited manufacturing with 5-acre minimum lots).
	*	The recommendation goes to the city council for approval — a vote planned for May 9.
	*	The new zoning would require five-acre lots, a building hight of two stories, and restrict floor area to 20% of the lot. Additionally, 35% of the lot would b maintained in open, green area and 25% for parking.
	*	“The commission’s action, following a public hearing on the issue one week ago, represented an obvious attempt at compromise. But it fell short of the hopes of groups opposing industrial expansion to the foothills.”
	*	Joseph Williamson of CCRP: describes the zoning “an awkward arrangement” and expressed disappointment. But he was pleased to see the agricultural-conservation zoning for the southern acreage along Arastradero. He would have preferred to see AC zoning for the entire area.
	*	Los Altos Hills Mayor Fowle was pleased to see the elimination of industrial frontage, but “the real fear of the local residents is still the potential of an additional 10,000 employes in excess of the 15,000 to 20,000 potential already existing in the older portion of the Stanford industrial tract.”

	*	The Times takes a swipe at those opposed to industrialization: “We would be a bit more inclined to jump abroad their ‘orderly planning’ bandwagon . . . Were it not for a wee bit of suspicion that ‘planning’ in this case is being used . . . To be saying ‘let’s get some orderly planning in the foothills so long as it’s for residential and not industrial use.’”
	*	The *Times* argues that “orderly planning” means answering tough questions: “Where are we going to provide the incomes for our growing population? How are we going to pay for all the services our people want and need — schools, streets parks, recreation? How are we going to build those youth centers people are talking about, that senior citizens center, the new library facilities? How are we to expand utilities, police and fire protection, all those municipal services we too often take for granted? How are we going to keep the economic life of our community rich and vital, so that we can all enjoy the standard of living and culture we need and want?”

	*	He writes: “As for traffic congestion, some of us have noted from our insurance rates that traffic accidents and fatalities are already very high in this area. After all the talk about what Palo Altoans want, we wonder why some of the civic officials are afraid to place this vital question of industry in the foothills on the public ballot.”

	*	Editorial by Holly Herr (Palo Alto)
	*	Warning that more industry means more automobiles. She argues that it “isn’t known exactly what damage we’re doing to our lungs and those of our children, but it is known that because of the peculiarities of the layers of our atmosphere, we have a greater smog potential than Los Angeles.”

	*	“Unfortunately, Mr. Whyte falls into the same error into which the many opponents of the current issue have fallen. This is that those foothills will remain as they are until eternity.”
	*	Argues that the open space of the foothills cannot remain because of increasing population pressure and economic pressure because Stanford needs to make income.
	*	There’s an interesting shift in views here, I think. The discussion has turned the “let there be residential areas” upside-down — arguing that residential development could become more unsightly than industrial development with strict development guidelines.
	*	“Too often forgotten is the role of Stanford University itself in keeping the area attractive. Stanford’s 9,000 acres have constituted a free park for the people of Palo Alto and surrounding communities. If these broad acres had been owned by other private interests, they long ago would have been converted to the houses, business places and industries where so many of us live and work—including those who oppose Stanford’s industrial expansion.”

	*	Editorial by William Whyte (New York City)
	*	Giving an “outsider comment on the foothills situation”
	*	Citing his studies of communities and their planning problems.
	*	Warns that “a number of communities have let their key remaining open spaces be commercialized” and “now realize how much these natural assets had defined the character of the area—and how irretrievable, once gone.”
	*	Warns that “no one had been for the destruction of the open spaces . . . The open spaces had been nibbled away.”
	*	The open spaces were more than aesthetics; they “helped structure the community’s layout” and were “vital to the long range appeal of the community—and their destruction had put a heavier burden on the community’s service load and did not, over the long run, help the very tax base invoked to justify their commercialization.”
	*	Says Palo Alto is “blessed” with open space, and “it still has the power of choice.”
*	“Councilman answers critics,” p. 16

	*	Expressing approval of the council’s action for annexation.
	*	“The time has come, however, when Stanford University can no longer afford the tremendous tax burden assessed upon their lands, taxes which far exceed any possible income from agricultural use.”
	*	“As the industrial park expands I stand to lose a sizable portion of the farm lands I have leased for many years. I should not like to see these beautiful hills carved into small residential lots. The light industrial use under highly restrictive zoning proposed by the university seems to me to be in keeping with the character of this land.”
	*	Cites that similar complaints were made when the Industrial Park was initially founded, but because of the high design standards, high quality tenants, and has been well planned in cooperation with public planners, the site is “certainly one of the finest in the country and has achieved international recognition.”

	*	Believes that the US may not be able to lead the world through “sheer force,” so in order “to survive we must provide moral leadership for the world” which will be found in “the best possible education to be prepared for such leadership. In addition we must educate whatever foreign students we can to help spread our traditions throughout the world.”
	*	Supporting annexations means supporting Stanford to use its resources to the best of its abilities.
*	“No vote recommended,” p. 17
	*	Editorial by Dorothy Varian (Cupertino)
	*	Worries about the loss of “irretrievable beauty of the hills” and concerned that Palo Alto will “set a precedent for others to follow.”
	*	“As our population increases, it becomes absolutely necessary to coordinate planning for residential areas, industries, commercial zones and roadways.”
	*	Says that the common idea was the hillsides were for residential and recreation, while flatlands would be for industrial development. “This proposal calls for Palo Altans to make a decision which reverses all previous land use concepts for this area.”
	*	Hits at Stanford, which is urging a quick decision so Ampex doesn’t back out. Dorothy argues that “this is not adequate justification for hasty action without taking the time to make a comprehensive regional plan which will benefit all our communities.”
