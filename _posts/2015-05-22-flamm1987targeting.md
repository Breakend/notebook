pp. 6--8: Growth of high tech industry directly linked to World War II. Mobilization of scientists and engineers during the war and increased government role in supporting wartime research and technology meant unprecedented growth.‚Å†

p. 42: "Between 195 and 1955 the U.S. Government dominated computer development. All major computer technology projects in the United States were supported by government and military users. Between 1955 and 1965, however, a commercial, business-oriented market for computers grew rapidly, drastically reducing the government's share of the action. Government users still dominated in high-performance, large-scale scientific computers, and advanced technology projects paid for by the federal authorities accounted for much of the technical advance in computers."

p. 43: Five federal agencies tended to provide the bulk of resources for computer research: Department of Defense, Atomic Energy Commission, Energy Research and Development Agency, Department of Energy, National Science Foundation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and National Institutes of Health.
