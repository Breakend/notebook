The group originally called themselves Citizens for Regional Recreation and
Parks (CRRP) and emerged in the wake of a June 3, 1958, conference in San
Francisco called "The Peril To Our Public Lands---A Discussion of Regional
Recreation." The core concern that emerged from the meeting was the lack of
regional parks in California's metropolitan regions and a desire among the
participants to establish more outdoor recreational areas.^[@kent1970openspace,

Dorothy Erskine, Jack Kent, and colleagues founded Citizens for Regional
Recreation and Parks (CRRP) on June 17, 1958, to protect parks and recreational
areas in the Bay Area. The coalition contained representatives from other
conservationist groups already working in the area, including the Sierra Club,
San Francisco Planning and Housing Administration, and Marin Conservation
League. The group sought to collectively share information, develop a policy
on regional conservation, and support educational programs regarding open
space.^[@kent1970openspace, 69.]

The CRRP's early campaigns included creating an inventory of public lands
("state and local parks, water district property, military reservations, and
similar lands") to distribute to Bay Area leaders, sponsored conferences (one on
December 11, 1959, in Richmond, another on January 27, 1961, in San Francisco,
and another on January 26, 1962) on open space and conservation in partnership
with the Extension Division of the Department of City and Regional Planning at
the University of California-Berkeley.^[@kent1970openspace, 69--70.]

In addition to fostering partnerships with regional conservationists and
supporting educational programs, CRRP supported various conservation proposals.
The first in 1960 involved calling attention to the sale of surplus federal
lands by the General Services Administration (GSA), 73 acres of Fort Baker up
for public auction. However, the GSA failed to follow the normal procedures of
allowing local governments to purchase the acreage at half its appraised value
and instead declared the auction open to private developers before government
agencies. CRRP brought the matter to Congress, which supported HR 12798,
directing the GSA to offer the Fort Baker property to the State, and asked
Congress to amend the Administrative Services Act of 1949 to ensure that GSA
offered the sale of surplus lands to local and state governments before public
auction. The Fort Baker auction was eventually canceled, but the CRRP's
activities allowed the City of San Francisco to purchase Fort Funston at half
the fort's value in November 1961.^[@kent1970openspace, 70--71.]

The group also helped establish plans for long-term planning and conservation of
open space and asked the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) to develop
a comprehensive plan for regional land use. ABAG and CRRP President Mel Scott
applied for and received federal aid to undertake the study, along with
assistance from CRRP to draft questionnaires. CRRP continued to engage with
local politics, supporting Senate Bill 309 on Bay Area planning; preventing the
Corps of Engineers from filling the Bay near Bay Farm Island; called on the San
Mateo County Planning Commission to avoid commercial development near Coyote
Point Park; urged Marin County planners to obtain scenic easements to
preserve the Marin hills; and supported Proposition I in 1964.

CRRP's educational efforts manifested themselves in the monthly circulation of
*Regional Exchange*, a leaflet published between 1966-1968 that summarize reports
issued by the Bay Conservation and Development Commission and ABAG. Many copies
were purchased by civic organizations to distribute to their members. Schools,
libraries, and politicians received complementary copies.

In 1968, CRRP engaged in three major campaigns. The first, Proposition C in San
Francisco was supported by CRRP which would have provided bonds necessary to
purchase 12.5 acres around the Cliff House to prevent apartment construction.
The group also supported the Marin Conservation League in advocating Angel
Island State Park be maintained in its natural state. Finally, CRRP supported
efforts to create an agricultural preserve in Napa Valley.

That same year, CRRP also became a nonprofit, tax-exempt corporation and changed
its name to People for Open Space. Changing the name allowed the group to obtain
a $59,000 Ford Foundation grant to examine the economic impact of open space in
the Bay Area, the first study of its kind in the United
States.^[@kent1970openspace, 74; "Ideas for Discussion with Ford Foundation,"

[pos1969impact](), as well as a summary pamphlet [pos1969case]().^["The Case for Open
Space in the San Francisco Bay Area," (San Francisco: People for Open Space,

POS continued to campaign for open space in the 1970s, helping establish the
Mid-Peninsula Open Space District in 1972 and the Suisan Marsh in 1974. The
group continued to work towards regional government to protect the environmental
and economic quality of the Bay Area. In 1976 the group added establishing
a permanent regional greenbelt to their agenda. They established the Greenbelt
Congress in 1984 as a parallel group that fought for open space through activism
and grassroots organizing.
