Reading the chapter on Ted Smith:

* "Many a trekkie fast-tracker lives a life very much insulated from more crusty, gritty realities. Those who seek and speak with only their own kind here--and that is a very easy thing to do in a freeway society--have the validity of an exclusive existence reinforced, to the exclusion of other realities." (251-252)
* Ted Smith's law office located near the governmental center of San Jose whose main interest is contaminants getting into the water supply (252)
* Smith bio:
    * undergraduate studies at Wesleyan University in Connecticut (252)
    * spent several lyears in VISTA in the late 1960s (252)
    * earned a law degree from Stanford, and started a general law practice in San Jose in 1973 (252)
    * "I was certainly shaped by the '60s. I think I trace much of my present attitudes to my experiences in VISTA in the late '60s. I was in Washington, D.C., where aobut once a week we'd see a major demonstration or riot. . . . "I think I got seared as a VISTA. I think things were so intense then that I just haven't been able to put it out of my soul. Maybe that's the difference." (261)
* Smith was, in part, motivated by his work as a labor lawyer: "The original interest came from seeing fairly significant numbers of assembly workers coming down with what seemed to be bizarre, disabling injuries and illnesses. And I began to learn more about the electronics industry and the fact that it is a chemical-handling industry." (252-253)
* The Regional Water Quality Control Board found that 85 percent of the holding tanks they tested had signs of leaks and contamination (as of 1985) (253)
* The *Bulletin of the Santa Clara County Medical Society* reported thirty-one families in the area of the Fairchild leak in San Jose with bith defects, miscarriages, or sillborns. (253)
* Santa Clara Valley gets 60% of its water from the aquifers (254)
* The idea for a model ordinance regarding contamination originated with the Santa Clara County Fire Chiefs' Association. Firefighters were often first responders to reports of leaks, and they demanded a right-to-know what they were dealing with. Working with a coalition of businesses and trade groups, a new organization called the Industry Environmental Coordinating Committee launched in spring 1982 and put forth a proposal for a Hazardous Materials Model Code for the city council. (254)
* Smith objects to their proposal, suggesting that their draft did not want to make public the disclosure of information to nearby communities (in fact, it was criminalized). The association argued they did not want to reveal any trade secrets. Smith and others objected, arguing that the public had a right to know as well: "we needed to have a public that was as informed and knowledgable as possible, so the people could make decisions in their own lives about where they wanted to live, where they wanted to send their kids to school, where they wanted to work." (255)
* Concerns over the draft proposal by IECC helped give rise to SVTC, which involved labor groups, homeowners, firefighters, clergy, victims, and representatives from medicine and the environmental movement. They initially sought to balance the strength of the industry coalition. (255)
* SVTC extended its interests beyond the model ordinance proposal, taking up issues of requiring double containment holding tanks, electronic monitoring of underground tanks, mandatory reporting of leaks and spills, protection for whistleblowers, and industry financing of compliance. (255)
* Smith speculates that part of the reason there are issues with leaks is because many of the companies are foreign owned, including Fairchild which was purchased by the French firm Schulmberger in 1979. (257)
* Smith: "I wonder whether the fact they do not seem to have such serious problems has anything to do with the fact of absentee ownership. The people who run most of these companies live here in this valley, although most of your top managers don't live on the valley floor. Most of them live up in the hills and up in the northern part of the county . . . the air is a little better up there." (257)
