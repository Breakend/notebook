p. 3: "This book is about American havens. It suggests that the space around
us --- the physical organization of neighborhoods, roads, yards, houses, and
apartments --- sets up living patterns that condition our behavior."

On California

pp. 265-266: Jackson uses Santa Clara County as an example of a "centerless city"
--- places that "never had a true urban focus" and "lacked a commutation focus"
--- and points to San Jose as the "nation's largest suburb." San Jose had
fewer than 70,000 residents in 1940, but exploded to 636,000 by 1980 and
surpassing San Francisco as the largest municipality.

p. 266: "Home builders, encouraged by a San Jose city government that annexed
new territory at a rapid pace and borrowed heavily to build new utilities and
schools on the fringes of town, moved farther and farther into the rural
outskirts."

p. 266: "As Santa Clara County became a national symbol of the excesses of
uncontrolled growth, its residents began to fear that the high-technology
superstars were generating jobs and taxes, but that the jobs attracted more
people, and the taxes failed to cover the costs of new roads, schools, sewers,
and expanded police and fire departments."
