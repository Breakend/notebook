Ted Smith is the founder and former executive of the [Silicon Valley Toxics
Coalition]() and co-founder of the International Campaign for Reponsible
Technology. He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1967 and Stanford Law
School in 1972.

Ted Smith writes an essay titled "Chief Seattle's Prophecy," a speech that
becomes very seminal to environmentalists.^[Smith, "Chief Seattle's Prophecy,"
Folder 3 Box 18, Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition Papers, San Jose State
University Special Collections and Archives.] However, there's evidence to
suggest no speech was ever made. We know there was an Indian named Seeathl,
and we know that Seattle is named for him. But otherwise, the speech borders
on what Jill Lepore called "a shabby sort of historical
ventriloquism."^[Evidence on Seeathl's speech from [klingle2007emeraldcity](),
42. Lepore quote from [klingle2007emeraldcity](), 42.]
