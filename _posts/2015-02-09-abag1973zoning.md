{% reference abag1973zoning %}

p. 1: The third publication in a series of three. The first publication discussed the need for a regional growth policy in the San Francisco Bay Area. The second discussed population growth and recommended short- and long-term regional plans for a growth policy. The third considers zoning in a regional growth policy.

p. 1: ABAG suggests that zoning serves two purposes:

1. "To segregate 'nuisance' activities from other land uses, resulting in maintenance of land values and salability;"

2. "To ensure the greatest overall long-range benefit to individuals, communities, and the region by achieving the best use of land. Such land use control results from a planning process which weighs alternative uses against the overall objectives of the community."

p. 1: "The first purpose reflects the older market-oriented view of zoning, while the second represents a more recent and broader view of zoning which seeks to protect long-run land values by making the best use of land resources for the benefit of the entire community."
