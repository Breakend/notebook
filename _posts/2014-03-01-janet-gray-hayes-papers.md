Description:

> In 1974 Janet Gray Hayes became mayor of San Jose, California and the
> first female elected to the office of mayor of a large American city.
> She was overwhelmingly reelected to a second term, and served as mayor
> until 1982. Prior to her groundbreaking election in 1974, she won a
> seat on the San Jose City Council and also served as vice mayor. This
> collection documents her political trajectory from 1974-1982. During
> her tenure as mayor she focused on urban development issues and smart
> growth planning, and was very responsive to increased citizen access
> to the mayor's office. Hayes became an important role model for women
> in politics, her success in government represented a watershed for
> politically minded women in the region, and the Santa Clara Valley
> became know as the "Feminist Capital of the World." This collection
> consists of administrative files, election materials, personal files,
> and public relations materials, most of which were amassed while Hayes
> served as city council member, vice mayor, and mayor of San Jose.

# Notes

**Looking at material on 2014-05-17**:

* Box 1, Folder 20
  * "A Survey of Voter Attitudes in the City of San Jose," Diridon Research
  Corporation, 1974
    * pp 164 total
    * Surveying voter attitudes; photographed relevant passages on
    environment, growth, and open space.
* Box 1, Folder 13
  * Clippings, Mayoral Reelection Campaign 1978
    * "Mrs. Hayes opens mayor campaign"
      * She's citing her "balanced urban growth" as a key feature in her bid
      for reelection. This is significant.
      * Image caption in the SJMN of June 1978 notes that Hayes ran "on a
      limited growth platform. The election of a Hayes ally to the city
      council gives the limited growth forces a majority."
      * Photographed some key articles from here. This campaign is good -- a
      good example of how growth became an explosive political issue. The
      entire campaign between Garza and Hayes surrounded issues of growth.
