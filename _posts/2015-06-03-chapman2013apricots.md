> Each pot was about two feet long and a food wide. It stood on legs. A stack
> like a stovepipe projected from the top . . . The smoke from the burning pots
> raised the temperature of the air enough so the frost did little or no damage
> . . . In the morning one had to do a good job of nose cleaning. It surely
> became dirty breathing the black night air . . . It wasn't a pleasant time
> for anyone, but a very necessary procedure if we were to have a crop. I've
> seen the time when we lost everything because the pots weren't lighted in
> time.
