How does space and place matter to Silicon Valley's environmentalists?

Thinking through this a bit more, this interplay of space and place is fairly important to the story. There are certain *spaces* defined for particular purposes.

# Reading Landscapes

After a conversation with Leisl last week at HASTAC (May 27--30, 2015), she told an excellent anecdote about thinking about landscapes, the importance of place, and the problem of not understanding how to read a landscape. Her example, as I'm remembering it, is imagine visiting an Indian reservation in the Southwest and stumbling across a car up on blocks---not an uncommon sight on reservations (nor, frankly, in many places in the US). On the one hand, the popular perception of that vehicle might be a symbol of poverty, laziness, and other embedded assumptions. What's missing is the *reality* of that car: it exists on blocks because it's being used for parts to keep a working vehicle in good condition. It's too much trouble to drive the distance to a city from the reservation to fix a vehicle; it's easier to use a broken-down vehicle for parts as you need them. It's about reading the landscape.
