The Citizens Committee for Regional Planning formed among Palo Alto residents on March
10, 1960, and elected Robert R. Mahan chairman pro-tem.^[Mahan was an insurance
executive.] The group opposed industrial development in the Stanford foothills,
but offered to work with Stanford to design a development plan that satisfied
all parties.
