Stegner notes he was one of the co-founders of the Committee for Green
Foothills. He estimates the original membership around 12-15 people because "of
things that seemed to be happening in the hills that we didn't like to see
happen" and a "fear of what Stanford might do in the hills, since Stanford owned
a lot of them." (pp. 7-8)

The group was organized in 1961 or 1962; founding members included Lois Hogle,
Ruth Spangenberg, Morgan and Katy Stedman, Gary Girard -- "all good citizens,
good conservationists, good stewards." Many of them became town officials in
Palo Alto and Portola Valley. (p. 8)

Calls the group "very neighborhoody" and notes many of the original volunteers
were women. (p. 8)

Stegner says he has to "say good things for Stanford" â€” "they're the biggest
landholder on the Peninsula, so they have an enormous effect, but they're also
much more responsible than ordinary profit-minded developers would be." (p. 8)

Stegner does criticize Stanford for not building housing into the Industrial
Park, causing everyone to "go to Mountain View" and "make enormous traffic
patterns back and forth, or over to Alviso or somewhere to find a reasonable
house to live in." (p. 9)

Stegner notes two battles that the Committee engaged in:

* They stopped Stanford from building up to Page Mill Road -- "they were going
to put a road up Old Page Mill, canalize the creek, cement the creek, and so on
up past the Frechman's tower." They convinced Stanford to come over the hill
instead, where 280 meets Foothill and Page Mill. Stanford "talked the county
into it" as well, leaving the "little intimate canyon and the old Frenchman's
tower" in peace. (p. 9)
* The Committee opposed plans by a guy named Luckman
[who is this?] who was hired by Palo Alto to plan foothills land. Stegner calls
him a "real madman." He planned to put high-rises up the skyline to support
a population of seventy thousand in the foothills. They opposed it, and along
with the Livingston-Blaney Report, convinced Palo Alto it was cheaper to buy the
land and hold it as open space than to develop it. (p. 9)

The interviewer notes Lucille Hillstad, former mayor and councilperson of Los
Altos Hills, who is accused of taking bribes from developers. (p. 10)

Stegner notes that Los Alto Hills was limited to one-acre lots and was intended
"to be a country town, remain country -- we formed the city in order to remain
country." (p. 10) Los Altos Hills later became "the developer's paradise" as
newcomers "who hadn't any particular feel for the country" and "turned out to be
development-minded" redirected the town towards "the idea of profit." (p. 9-10)

Stegner helped in the outlining and research of Udall's *The Quiet Crisis*. (p. 13)
