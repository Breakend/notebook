Joe Ridder's family owned the *San Jose Mercury*, purchased in 1952. Ridder
believed in the same pro-growth vision of [Dutch Hamann](), and as Hamann
provided the implementation for growth Ridder provided an outlet to campaign for
growth.

Matthews writes that "we can safely conclude that because of them [Ridder and
Hamann], the growth was speedier and more of it was funneled into the jurisdiction
of San Jose per se."^[Matthews, 96]
