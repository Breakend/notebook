## Sewers

n.p.: "No city on the Pacific Coast possesses a better natural drainage than San Jose, and there is no city in which the natural advantages have been so well improved."

n.p.: City has forty miles of main and branch sewers, leading to an outlet at the tidewaters of the Bay. 

## Water Supply

n.p.: Water supply is drawn from streams and fountains of the Santa Cruz Mountains. 

n.p.: Water is owned by "an incorporated company and its rates are subject to control by the city. The popular feeling is, however, that the city should be the absolute owner of its water supply and there is every reason to believe that this object will be accomplished within a reasonable time."

n.p.: "The supply [of water], under the present system, has been ample for all requirements and the resources in this direction seem capable of keeping pace with the growth of the city for many years to come."

n.p.: "pure water from the bowels of the earth can be obtained in unlimited quantities and at little expense. The subterranean streams seem to be inexhaustible and, when called upon, yield a response that is more than satisfactory."
