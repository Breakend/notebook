## Box 4 Financial

### Folder 1

* Data relating to SCCOSH. Nothing of use.

## Box 10 Hazardous Materials Storage

### Folder 1

* "Chemicals Detected in Groundwater Beneath Industrial Sites in Santa Clara
County (1982)" (Citizens for a Better Environment)
    * Listing of fifty-one chemicals identified under industrial sites.

### Folder 2

* Letter from Reed to Medigovich, Jan 30, 1986
    * William medigovich is the director of the governor's Office of Emergency
    Services
    * County Executive Sally Reed is informing Medigovich that Santa Clara
    County Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution on January 28, 1986,
    designating a Hazardous Materials Unit of the Santa Clara County Health
    Department as part of implementing AB2185.
    * Enclosed with the letter is the resolution.
* "Why We Need AB 1362," SVTC mailer, Jul 25, 1983
    * AB 1362 proposed by Assemblyman Byron Sher (Dem., Mt. View) requires
    industries to meet stringent “design and performance requirements to
    prevent leaks of dangerous chemicals” and would “require permits and
    regular inspection of underground tanks by local governments, and would
    require operators to report chemical leaks within 24 hours.”
    * AB 1362 passed the state assembly but ran into resistance in the state
    Senate. The bill has support from the California Federation of Labor,
    Citizens for a Better Environment, the Sierra Club, Federated Firefighters
    of California, California Medical Association, Health Officers
    Organization of California, and California League of Cities.
    * Swing votes are Senators Rosenthal, Montoya, Carpenter, and Maddy.
* Clippings
    * "Group fights for toxic-waste ordinance," *Peninsula Times Tribune* Nov
    4 1982
        * Ted Smith: “We’re trying to bring as many people as possible
        together on an apple-pie-and-motherhood kind of issue—fighting toxic
        wastes.”
        * The article is citing the creation of SVTC “at a press conference
        this morning in front of City Hall.”
        * Goal of SVTC is to “fight for passage of a model toxic wastes
        ordinance recently developed by the Santa Clara County Fire Chiefs
        Association.” The ordinance seeks to designate controls on chemical
        storage tanks and establish laws for storage and handling of toxic
        wastes.

### Folder 3

* City of Sunnyvale, Minutes of Attorneys Committee, Mar 17 1983
    * The memos produced below by Joan Gallo are mentioned in this document,
    with amendments added to some of the language.
* City of San Jose Memorandum, Gallo to Scott, 3/9/83
    * Draft provided to identify carcinogens in accordance with Cal-OSHA
    Carcinogen Registration List.
    * The memo calls for facilities to report material stored at facilities if
    material generated exceeds 500 pounds in weight for solids, 55 gallons for
    liquids, or 200 cubic feet at standard temperature and pressure for
    gases.
* Memorandum, Gallo to Scott, 3/16/83

### Folder 4

* Minutes of the Type and Quality/Permit Subcommittee Meeting, Oct 15, 1982
* "We Demand Safe Water," SVTC publication, n.d.
    * A mailer of SVTC
    * Lists the location of spills and chemical leaks in Santa Clara County as
    of March 1983, including a map of the locations.
    * "Silicon Valley residents recehive more than 50% of our drinking water
    from underground water wells. Several of these wells have now been shut
    down due to contamination, and more are sure to follow. Ground water moves
    slowly--the chemicals now in our ground water may take months or years to
    reach our wells."
    * "Don't Let Industry Do Their Business In Our Water" slogan
    * RWQCB reports that 85% to 90% of monitoring wells dug near chemical
    storage have found evidence of contamination.
    * Flier notes that over 70,000 chemicals are used by industry. "Very vew
    of these chemicals have ever been tested for health effects and powerful
    industry lobbies continue to prevent effective regulation."
    * Quoting Lorraine Ross: "Our daughter was born with a congenital heart
    problem. My family and I feel like human guinea pigs whose health is being
    tested by the 'high-tech' companies doing business in our valley." (np)
    * Lil Ruscigno, Public Health nurse: "Water is like our atmosphere, a
    community asset. If it gets contaminated, we all lose, whether it be a
    fetus in utero, infant, child, adult or senior citizen. If contaminated
    water were a communicable disease, we would be in the middle of an
    epidemic."
        * *is Lil related to Joe?*
* Map, "Recent Underground Chemical Leaks and Spills in Santa Clara County"

### Folder 5

* Clippings
    * "Committee stalls chemical-storage bill," SJM, Jul 14, 1983
        * [Byron Sher]()'s bill is postponed "after it became clear that it
        did not have enough votes to pass."
        * The main objection to the bill from electronics manufacturers is
        that it would allow cities to adopt additional restrictions on top of
        statewide regulations.
        * The senate committee's inaction means the bill is killed for the
        year's legislative session.
    * "Cities lag on enforcing toxics laws," SJM, 1/22/86
        * Sunnyvale released a report that out of the 745 city businesses that
        store gasoline and chemical solvents, only 189 have passed inspection
        (after the city passed its ordinance three years before)
        * Ted Smith notes that many cities are overwhelmed by the requirements
        and don't have the staff resources to keep up.
    * "Chips industry adapting to new codes," SJM, 12/17/84
        * Bob Campbell, chemist with the Santa Clara Fire Department: "The
        image was it was a clean industry because everyone was running around
        in those bunny suits. . . . Now we're reaping the hurt from that. We
        didn't know what we were dealing with. We're catching up."
        * Chemicals: compressed gases such as
        arsine and phoshine are used to alter the electrical characteristics
        of silicon chips, and corrosive acids (hydrofluoric, sulfuric, and
        nitric) are used in cleaning chips.
        * Mountain View Fire Marshal Frank Moe: "They use arsine gas--that was
        made by the military to kill people. They have a potential for a real
        big problem and you can't turn your back on it because it hasn't
        happened yet."
        * Fire officials agree that the code favors industry. San Jose and
        Hayward, frustrated by the loopholes in the code, won't adopt the
        code.
        * Industry argues that the compromise worked out between fire
        officials and industry is significant. Larry Borgman, manager of
        facilities planning and engineering at Intel, says he was "proud" of
        the compromise and said it "showed the initiative to go forward to do
        something we didn't have to do."
            * **I find this statement odd. Arrogant, almost?**
        * Fire officials wanted three tougher provisions: 1) strict limits on
        the amount of toxic materials stored in fabrication areas; 2) greater
        fire resistance in walls surrounding manufacturing areas; 3)
        manufacturing areas separate from offices and general public areas.
        * The requirement for a separate corridor for hazardous materials was
        the compromise between industry and fire officials, which left both
        sides unpleased.
    * "Industry amendments dilute safe water bill," *Northern California Labor* vol 36 no. 5 (Sept 9, 1983)
        * Responding to [Byron Sher]()'s bill.
        * Says the bill "ran into an all-out offensive mounted by the major
        oil and gas companies, PG&E and the California Manufacturers
        Association.
        * The bill was modeled after the Santa Clara model ordinance.
    * "Cupertino orders hazardous materials permits," SJM, 8/2/83
        * The Cupertino city council voted that businesses storing hazardous
        materials will need to apply for permits, following the model
        ordinance adopted by the Intergovernmental Council.
        * As many as 200 to 300 facilities will be affected by the ordinance.
        * Businesses not complying with the regulations are subject to as much
        as \$500 fine per day.
        * Cupertino's three city wells were shut down in December when
        officials discovered leaks from solvent tanks at Tandem Computers Inc
        in Vallco Park. Although the chemicals were not detected in the city
        water supply, they shut down the wells as a precaution.
        * Santa Clara, San Jose, Palo Alto, Milpitas, Sunnyvale, Los Gatos,
        Campbell, and Gilroy had all passed similar ordinances.
    * "Electronics firms oppose state law to control leaks," SJM, Jul
    13, 1983
        * Resistance to a statewide law to control underground storage of
        chemicals coming from the American Electronics Association, a national
        trade organization.
        * They are reacting till [Bill Sher]()'s bill.
            * **The paper claims is a Palo Alto Assemblyman; I thought he was
            from Mountain View. Check on this.**
        * Notes that in Santa Clara County alone 56 sites of shallow
        underground contamination have been discovered.
    * "Slow progress in cataloging toxic threats," SJM, 4/13/86
        * Bayview Industrial Park was "leveled" by an explosion on April 4.
        Fire fighters had no idea what hazardous materials were stored at the
        site.
            * The paper later notes this was an illegal fireworks factory.
        * The city had adopted a hazardous materials storage ordinance two
        years prior, but city fire officials admitted it hadn't implemented the program.
        * Cities and the county have granted five-year permits to 2,024
        (48.9%) of the 4,140 permit applicants.
        * San Jose Fire Department has received the most applicants of any
        other city, at 1,646.
        * State legislators used Santa Clara County's ordinance as a basis for
        the state law regulating underground storage of hazardous material.
        And Washington was impressed with California's underground program
        that it implemented a similar program nationwide in 1984.
    * "EPA Acting to Halt Leaks in Underground Fuel Tanks," NYT 4/3/87
        * find this on ProQuest; not photographed
    * "Slow Going on Toxics," SJM, 3/25/87
        * Editorial of the *Mercury News*.
        * The EPA has been critical of San Jose, where under the Hazardous
        Materials Program 1,660 toxic storage facilities were to be inspected and
        issued permits, but only half have been dealt with.
        * [Peter W. Jones]() administered the program; he "mysteriously
        disappeared in January"
            * **What's this about?**
        * The EPA estimates that in 90% of the 320 cases where underground
        leaks have been discovered in Santa Clara County, no determination has
        been made about whether chemicals reached groundwater.
        * Blame for the delay is placed on cities and counties who don't have
        the means or expertise needed for cleanup; a lack of clarity about
        their legal authority in enforcing cleanup; California law allows
        state and regional water quality control boards to enforce cleanup of
        below-surface contamination, but Gov. Deukemjian has vetoed funds for
        the program.
    * "Expand toxics program, city urged," SJM, 5/27/87
        * SVTC claims that San Jose is avoiding known contamination sites,
        which may lead to a chance of undetected chemical spills and leaks.
        * And because small companies pay smaller fees to cover the cost of
        inspection, the program is beginning to collapse because of its cash
        flow problem.
        * A report by SVTC claims that the program only recovered \$301,240 of
        its \$1.1 million program cost.
        * SVTC calls on the city to increase the staff and budget of the fire
        department's hazardous materials program, and require the program to
        charge up front fees and concentrate on inspecting larger companies.
        * SVTC supports a fire department proposal to increase the staff from
        6 to 16 and double the budget to \$1.2 million. Fees would be
        collected before inspection.
    * "Citizen groups complain big polluters don't pay," SF Examiner, May 27 1987
        * A report by Citizens for a Better Environment and the Silicon Valley
        Toxics Coalition says semiconductor manufacturers are not paying their
        fees and are not being inspected.
        * [Michael Belliveau](): "It's outrageous. Big business is getting a
        free ride here."
        * Industry confirms they haven't paid, but blames the city for not
        sending inspectors.
        * The report is being presented to the Environmental Committee of the
        San Jose City Council.
        * Citing figures by the fire department, in four years since San
        Jose's hazardous materials ordinance in 1983 only 43 percent have been
        inspected, issued permits, and charged fees.
        * The program has only generated 28% of the \$1 million cost, which
        has led taxpayers to subsidize the rest.
        * Yet the city has visited 70% of the city's gas stations and 57% of
        its auto repair shops, places "that are rated as relatively low toxic
        hazards."
        * [Clean Water Task Force]() is an industry group representing 90
        companies in Silicon Valley.
        * San Jose waits to collect fees until after its inspectors have
        visited the site; CWTF says that no companies have refused to pay the
        fees.
    * "San Jose may strengthen hazardous materials program," SJM, 5/28/1987
        * The City Council's environment committee approved a doubled budget
        and staff for the hazardous materials program, but held off on
        approving an increase of fees.
        * Industry disagrees with the fee hike. Jacqueline Bogard, director of
        environmental programs for the Santa Clara County Manufacturing Group,
        objects to budgeted money paying for a program that is unrelated--half
        of the Office of Environmental Management's toxics program. "Should we
        start paying 2 percent of the mayor's salary because he works on
        toxics? It's a deep pocket issue. They're asking industry to fund as
        many city programs as possible."
            * There's a politics here over funding and what industry's fair
            share should be.
        * Fire Chief Robert Osby says he didn't believe companies were
        refusing compliance.
    * "San Jose Hearing Points Up Toxic Risks at Area Plants," California AFL-CIO News, Feb 11 1983
        * Lorraine Ross surveyed her neighbors living near the Fairchild plant
        and claimed to find unusually high numbers of birth defects among
        babies in the area.
        * Mary Lou Lujan, a former Fairchild employee, claimed that chemicals
        were dumped in the area as well, not just leaked. She claims she lost
        her son as a result of birth defects.
    * Ted Smith photograph, *Cutting Edge*
    * "Labor in lead on toxic controls," Santa Clara County Labor, Feb
    11 1983
        * Mentioning of fears that Silicon Valley is another Love Canal
            * **this comes up often**
    * "Big Turnout Urged in San Jose to Curb Toxic Contamination," *California AFL-CIO News*, Jan 28, 1983
        * The Santa Clara County Labor Council is urging the adoption of the
        model toxic ordinance that's being opposed by National Association of
        Manufacturers, the Chamber of Commerce, and the electronics industry.
        * Peter Cervantes-Gautschi, business manager of SCCLC, says: "We want
        to prevent San Jose from being transformed into another Love Canal."
        * Strong support for the model ordinance also coming from AFL-CIO
        County Council of Fire Fighters and by Local 1245 of the International
        Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
        * Story notes with some concern that the RWCQB uses the EPA list of
        127 hazardous substances list rather than the 800 identified by the
        California Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
            * **This seems significant---criticisms of EPA identifying
            chemicals?**
    * "Toxic containment," SJM, Jan 22, 1990
        * Editorial of the *Mercury News*
        * Editorial is concerned with toxic gases, arguing that they could
        "cause immediate death, injury or illness."
        * To ensure safety of firefighters, an ordinance is being drafted.
        * City councils in the Bay Area will take up the model ordinance "in
        the weeks ahead."
        * Gases used in Silicon Valley include arsine and posphine in the
        manufacture of semiconductors, and chlorine for purifying water and
        sewage plants.
        * The real threat isn't that the gases are unregulated, but that a
        fire or earthquake releasing the gas cloud could threaten safety and
        force evacuations. One way to solve the issue is to strengthen the
        fire code.
        * The ordinance would assess the danger of various gases, require
        secondary containment measures that include automatic shutoff valves
        and seismic bracing of pipes and tanks. Retrofitting would be required,
        which many companies have already completed. But the *Mercury News*
        would like to see the force of law behind those requirements.
    * "Toxic gas leak is 'inevitable,' doctor warns," SJM June 6 1982
        * Reporting on the use of arsine gas in the manufacture of silicon
        chips, the gas is used to "impart electrical properties to the silicon
        chips." Inhaling the gas can cause kidney failure.
        * Dr. Joseph La Dou of the Peninsula Industrial Medical Clinic in
        Sunnyvale, warning that an earthquake could leak gases and called a
        leak "inevitable."
        * La Dou also criticized the transportation of these gases, as 68,000
        cubic feet of arsine are trucked into Silicon Valley along with
        phosphine.
        * La Dou says the fronts of electronic manufacturing facilities show
        no smokestacks or outward signs of pollution, but they store vast
        quantities of chemicals. Calls the high tech industry "troubled by
        health and safety issues that are going unanswered."
    * "Anti-spill measures still pend," SJM Jul 24 1982
        * At a town hall meeting at the Sunnyvale City Hall to talk about the
        ordinance drafted by the Fire Chiefs Association, a large part of the
        discussion revolved around how much the public should be told about
        the use and storage of hazardous material.
        * In June 1982 an explosion at IBM's South San Jose plant because of
        improperly stored aluminum waste that injured 18 people.
        * The draft ordinance had requirements for preventing leaks, gathering
        permits, comprehensive plans for handling toxic chemicals, and
        regulating the storage of materials. The ordinance would not disclose
        inventories of hazardous materials.
    * "Contamination law gets approval from Sunnyvale," SJM Mar 23
    1983
        * The Sunnyvale City Council agreed unanimously to adopt the model
        ordinance regulating chemical storage.
        * The ordinance took over a year to draft.
        * Sunnyvale has 400 tanks where businesses store toxic chemicals, many
        used by the computer industry.
    * "San Jose OKs ordinance regulating chemical storage," no source,
    2/23/83
    * "Danger: hazardous materials," SJM 2/3/83
        * Editorial of the SJMN
        * 117 children suffer from congenital heart defects, skin disorders
        and other medical problems
        * Among the 266 plaintiffs suing Fairchild
        * Fairchild plans to spend \$12 million on cleanup
        * "That disastrous leak, with all its human and financial costs, might
        never have occurred if the proper regulatory environment had existed
        for controlling the storage of toxic industrial chemicals."
        * Urging consideration of the Model Hazardous Materials Storage Permit
        Ordinance.
        * The ordinance is coming before the Inter-Governmental Council
        * Story notes a "committee of city managers" led by Sunnyvale's Thomas
        Lewcock. Who else is on this committee?
        * One of the objections to the ordinance are service station
        operators, but the SJMN says they should not receive exceptions
        because gasoline contains carcinogens (e.g., benzene additive). The story notes that tests
        indicate as many as 100,000 gas station tanks are leaking, which
        threatens water supplies.
    * "Intergovernmental panel endorses stiff rules to protect ground water," SJM Feb 5 1983
        * Santa Clara County's Intergovernmental Council endorsed the proposal
        "that would protect from retaliation employees who disclose their
        employers' poor chemical-disposal practices."
        * But the council "put off for further study" the expansion of the
        chemical list to 800.
        * The meeting lasted until midnight as they heard from people about
        fears that Santa Clara groundwater is being contaminated by high tech
        industry
        * The council endorsed the model ordinance, but their role is only
        advisory.
        * During the meeting, a state water quality expert told the council
        that eight new suspected leaks were under investigation and noted that
        "in 80 to 90 percent of the places where we're looking for leaks, we
        are finding them" (quoting Harold Singer, toxics division chief for
        the San Francisco Bay RWQCB).
        * The council also endorsed the requirement that gasoline would be
        stored in double-walled containers, despite lobbying by the petroleum
        industry.
        * Critics charge the council's action was an overreach of government
        control.
        * Ted Smith: "We are the leader in this because we are the leader in
        contamination of our ground water."
    * "Toxic storage debated," SJM 1/12/83
        * "ground water knows no city boundaries" mentioned by "several
        speakers"
    * "Industrial chemicals in Palo Alto," *Palo Alto Weekly* Nov 3 1982
        * Story reports that in the summer of 1982 explosions near Stanford
        were being conducted in a bunker; they were exploding ether, a
        substance that cannot be burned, buried, or transported. One of the
        explosions was too large and ignited a grass fire near Page Mill Road
        and west of Junipero Serra Boulevard that burned 32 acres of the
        foothills.
        * Story notes Dan Heiser, a firefighter with the Palo Alto Fire
        Department, who works as the hazardous chemical inspector.
        * "Palo Alto is luckier than some other cities because few local
        companies have underground tanks." Notes that HP reported five leaks
        but is pulling those tanks up and discontinuing their use.
        * "HP is one of the most cooperative and safety-conscious of the
        city's high-tech firms" and spent "$1.2 million last year for
        environmental safeguards on hazardous chemicals."
    * "Mayor urges ordinance on hazardous chemical spills," *East San Jose Sun*, 10/13/82
        * Hayes urging the adoption of an ordinance to prevent spills of
        hazardous chemicals.
    * "Get tough now to avoid spills," *Gilroy Dispatch* 7/1/83
        * Lorraine Ross is referred to as a Gilroyan.
            * **She moved to Gilroy after the leak was discovered in San
            Jose.**
        * At a meeting about chemicals in industry, attended by 60 people,
        watchdogs warned that Gilroy needed to be tough on industry before
        they arrive in the city.
        * Lorraine Ross: "We can't accept the dictates of Realtors and
        developers when it comes to determining the health of our families.
        You all have the right to talk loudly. It's important that Gilroy plan
        ahead for industry."
        * Ross: "They want these golden high-tech industries. They don't know
        they're a little tarnished with chemicals."
        * Ross now lives in Gilroy and found out that disk manufacturer Dysan
        plans to build a facility in the Santa Teresa Technology Park. She
        doesn't oppose their move to the park, but does not want to see
        industry near schools or homes.

        * San Jose opening a new office on environmental policies.
        * Businesses are worried that the municipal agency is a bureaucratic
        layer.
        * Office of Environmental Management
            * Proposed by Mayor Tom McEnery as a local Environmental
            Protection Agency
        * The new office received a $750,000 budget to combine the city's
        programs in hazardous materials, solid waste, and energy and water
        conservation, as well as coordinating the permit process for toxics
        enforcement.
        * The department's three main objectives: 1) improve city enforcement
        and regulation of environmental laws; 2) make "efficient use" of
        natural resources, including overseeing garbage collection and
        disposal contracts and promoting recycling; 3) work with city, county,
        state, and federal agencies, industrial groups, business organizations
        and environmental coalitions on issues.
        * The code compliance for toxics storage will stay with the Fire
        Department, but general toxics policy, toxic cleanup, and toxic
        control will be centralized into the new office.

        the storage of petroleum and other chemicals.
        * Formal legal adoption is expected in May
        * The law will require storage tanks to have an extra linear, and a
        leakage-monitoring system, and require existing tanks to be replaced
        with double-containment systems. Companies will be required to
        identify all stored chemicals. Those businesses that store chemicals
        must obtain permits from the city and are subject to inspection.

### Folder 5

* Folder is entirely related to Prop 65 and clean water. Mostly newspaper clippings.
* "Take Action for Clean Water" card
    * relating to Prop 65
    * flier created by Toxics Organizing & Oversight Committee on Zschau &
    Industry (T.O.O. C.O.Z.I.)
        * "too cozy"
    * Critical of [Ed Zschau]()'s position on Prop 65
        * they refer to him as Ed "Flip-Flop" Zschau.
    * "He may take the entire campaign to 'study' the issue. Maybe that is
    because so much of his campaign funding comes from the polluters who
    vigorously oppose Prop. 65!"
    * The flier is calling for a picket demonstration at the campaign
    headquarters of Zschau (Sept. 18 between 11a--1p) at 830 Maude Avenue.
* clippings
    * "Voters should join tap water rebellion" no source, no date
        * Editorial by [Ted Smith]().
        * No date, but he mentions "230 new toxic sites in the county in 1986
        alone," so probably dates to 1986.
        * The editorial is in favor of Proposition 65, because it 1) prohibits
        discharge into drinking water; 2) requires warning before exposing
        anyone to chemicals; and 3) increases enforcement options with
        penalties and citizen suit provisions.
        * The proposition also lifts the burden of proof in cases of
        scientific uncertainty: "It requires the polluter to prove that a
        listed chemical is safe rather than requiring the victim to prove that
        is is unsafe."
        * Smith says this leads to the heart of the public policy debate: "Who
        should bear the risks of scientific uncertainty---the victims of toxic
        exposure or the manufacturers and users of toxic chemicals?"
        * Smith says Prop 65 "encourages innovation" by encouraging safe
        chemical substitutes and promoting more testing of chemicals, which
        reduces the toxics problem at the source.

### Folder 6

    * Mostly clippings, still related to Prop 65

## Box 11: Groundwater Cleanup

### Folder 1

* Great Oaks Water Distribution Study, probably by Peter Murphy,
written sometime before March 1988
    * details in letter from Kathleen Claxton to Ted Smith, Mar 1
    1988, attached to this folder.
    * Report says it was November 1981 when Fairchild discovered that an
    underground tank had failed. The company determined that the leak occurred
    sometime after mid-1980 and that 60,000 gallons had entered the soil. (1)
    * A similar leak with smaller quantities at a nearby IBM plant was first
    reported in October 1980. (1)
    * In December 1981 Well No. 13 of the [Great Oaks Water Company]() was
    found to be contaminated with 1,1,1-trichloroethane. In March 1982, a
    Great Oaks Water Company well near IBM (Well No. 8) was also found
    contaminated. Both wells were removed from service. (1)
    * This study is looking at the concentrations of hazardous chemicals,
    their entrance into groundwater, and where that water from Wells 8 and 13
    were delivered. (2)
    * The pipe network under study ages from zero to 30 years.
    * The system uses three storage tanks, which go through cycles of
    depletion and refilling. They start mornings full because of low demand
    over night, begin to drop in the mornings and when a sensor detects the
    tanks have fallen five feet wells pump new water into the tanks. (23)
    * Well No. 13 was "the workhorse of the Great Oaks system" running almost
    continuously 24 hours a day every day of the year.
    * Coyote Creek runs along the eastern edge of the water basin. (33)
    * "Water currently enters the sand and gravel layers at a recharge area
    consisting of percolation ponds along Coyote Creek, at the extreme
    southeastern corner of the Great Oaks well field." (33)
    * TCA leaks from IBM began as early as 1972. The Fairchild plant started
    using TCA later than IBM but quantities they used rose quickly through
    1981.
    * p. 38: Map of plume areas of Fairchild.
    * The study found that water distribution from Well 8 went to nearby
    neighborhoods. (58)

### Folder 2

- Clippings
    - "Water contaminated by leak," SJMN Jan 20 (no year, probably 1982)
        - The well contaminated by Fairchild serves around 16,500 households
        in South San Jose.
        - Trichloroethane is an organic solvent known to cause damage to the
        central nervous system, the liver, and the cardiovascular system. It
        can also cause loss of coordination, eye irritation, and dizziness.
        Trichloroethane is used as a substitute cleaner for trichloroethylene,
        a "suspected cancer-causing agent."
        - Water was measured at 1.7 parts per million to 8.8 parts per
        million. The state's recommended maximum level for trichloroethane in
        drinking water is .3 parts per million.
        - The water company maintains that the contamination did not cause any
        health problems because the state's standards are based on long-term
        exposure.
        - Since Great Oaks is a private water company, the Santa Clara Valley
        Water District directors have no control over its operations. Arthur
        Pfeiffer, chairman of the district's board, said that if the well were
        controlled by the water district "it would be completely out to the
        public."
    - Photo, "Parents concerned about birth disorders," Feb 3 1982
    - "11 more cases swell birth disorder list," no source, no date
    - "Two new toxic leaks are discovered," no source but likely SJMN, Feb. 20, 1982
        - Story reporting that a chemical leak at Fairchild in Mountain View
        has been discovered at 10,000 times higher than the law permits.
    - "Concern over tainted water," SJM Feb 11 1982
        - Oak Grove High School neighborhood gathering to talk to local
        officials about the contamination.
        - Officials include city council members Jerry Estruth and Pat
        Sausedo; county Supervisor Susanne Wilson; Dr. Bernice Giansiracusa of
        the county health department; Betty Roeder, president of Great Oaks
        Water Company; and John Salazar, a Fairchild spokesman.
        - Janet Gray Hayes quotes from a letter from Governor Edmund G. Brown
        Jr: "Information currently available . . . would not lead the
        department (of health) to expect any serious health problems from the
        TCE contamination." Brown reported that the health department is
        considering legal action against Fairchild and documenting possible
        violations of state laws including improper storage and disposal of
        hazardous wastes.
    - "Birth of an eco-tragedy," *Los Angeles Herald Examiner* Feb 10 1982
        - The Fairchild chemicals aren't known at this time to be a carcinogen
        or teratogen, but they can be local irritants.
        - Dr. Bruce Ames, a biochemist specializing in mutagens and
        carcinogens at Berkeley, warns that it's not "worth scaring people by
        saying that it's associated. . . . there are lots of known things, like
        alcohol and cigarettes, that cause birth defects, and you get
        statistical abnormalities all the time anyway.."
        - Ross began compiling the list of mothers who have reported birth
        defects, which the Santa Clara County health department is using to
        start determining if there's a statistically high number of birth
        abnormalities in the area.
        - Fairchild maintains that the length of exposure wasn't long enough
        for health effects to become apparent.
        - Workers at Fairchild estimate that the leak began 18 months ago and
        took 16 months to seep into underground water wells 2,000 feet away.
        Since birth abnormalities began three years ago, Fairchild suggests
        that the incidents are unrelated.
        - Other reports of health problems for children: Lorraine; Julie
        Bowman adopted a baby boy who at 16 months developed a rare blood
        disease.
    - "Investigators may never know why birth defects occurred, expert says," SJMN Feb 6 1982
    - "Birth defects and chemicals," SJMN, Feb 3 1982
        - Editorial of the *Mercury News*.
        - The leak was discovered in the fall of 1981 when workers digging a
        hole for a new tank discovered stained soil.
        - In an area of one square mile over a period of three years, the
        neighborhood had seen two miscarriages, one stillbirth, and five cases
        of birth defects, four involving heart abnormalities. After the story
        broke, 11 more birth disorders were reported.
        - The paper suggests that there's a chance the birth defects are just
        a statistical coincidence, but "the coincidence is striking
        enough---and ominous enough---to demand investigation."
        - Ross: "We think it's time somebody found out what's going on here."
        - The paper is "downright disgusted" that drinking water "was
        contaminated with a potentially hazardous industrial chemical for
        months, maybe years, before the problem was discovered."
        - 18 months ago the state tested the wells in the Santa Clara Valley
        and they all checked out clean, but samples from one well was lost in
        transit---Well no. 13.
        - Photograph of Fairchild next to the affected neighborhood.
    - "Fairchild sued in toxic spill," *SJMN*, no date
        - Sixteen San Jose residents filed a multimillion dollar suit against
        Fairchild and Great Oaks, alleging their children suffered health
        problems including birth defects and cancer because of the water.
        - Story mentions San Jose attorney James Buccardo.
        - **Address**: Fairchild is located at 101 Bernal Road in South San Jose.
        - Plaintiffs argue that Fairchild improperly stored hazardous
        chemicals and Great Oaks was negligent in notifying its customers.
        - Fairchild notified Great Oaks on December 4, but residents did not
        find out until January 20.
    - "How safe is our drinking water?" no source but probably the SJMN, Feb 27
        - An editorial of the SJMN.
        - "If the present pattern continues, this newspaper might have to stop
        printing a separate story about each Silicon Valley hazardous chemical
        leak and just run a daily box score in agate type."
        - The editorial remarks on the report of a leak at Fairchild Mountain
        View of trichloroethylene and the trace chemicals found in Sunnyvale
        from Signetics Corp. These cases bring the total to 10 confirmed
        instances of groundwater contamination in Santa Clara County.
        - The editorial notes that Friday "came word that industrial solvents
        were leaking from storage tanks at Fairchild plants in Palo Alto and
        Santa Clara." The size of the leaks were not yet known.
        - "The Palo Alto and Santa Clara leaks were the third and fourth to
        turn up at Fairchild plants in Santa Clara County. Ironically, that's
        not because Fairchild is more negligent than other companies---it's
        because the firm is more conscientious. It began systematically
        checking all its underground tanks after the first leak was found in
        South San Jose."
        - Citing a study by CBE that indicated 38 Santa Clara County firms
        store hazardous chemicals underground.
        - Mayor Hayes asked Beverlee Myers, director for the state Department
        of Health Services for an immediate test for all drinking water wells
        in the county for nine chemicals, including trichloroethylene.
        - A spokesperson for the health department stated that water quality
        monitoring is a local responsibility and testing would be expensive.
        - The *Mercury* retorts: "THere are about 200 drinking water wells in
        this county; even if it cost $200 to test each of them the total would
        come to roughly $40,000. The state of California would spend that much
        to field-test a solar-heated doghouse. We think it's little enough to
        spend to ensure the safety---and the peace of mind---of more than a
        million of its citizens."
    - "Study of birth defects continues," *SJMN*, February 25, 1982
        - A committee of state and local health experts decides on a tentative
        further study to determine if there's a significant cluster in San
        Jose.
        - Dr. Glansiracusa said a check of birth certificates and infant-death
        and fetal-death records revealed "no significant difference" between
        county birth disorder rate and the birth disorder rate in the Los
        Paseos neighborhood.
            - **[Can I dig up any such data? Visualize by Census tract?]**
    - "2 toxic spills confirmed in North County," *SJMN*, February 25, 1982
        - Fairchild is responsible for the discovery of another leak in
        Mountain View, where "dangerously high levels of a potent industrial
        chemical contaminant."
        - Minute concentrations were also discovered in Sunnyvale, from
        Signetics Corp.
        - In Mountain View, trichloroethylene under Fairchild were 900 parts
        per million from a 42-foot-deep test well, 180,000 times higher than
        public health alert level for the cancer-causing chemical. The
        concentrations remained high even 500 feet away from the storage tank,
        between 1 and 50 ppm---10,000 to 50,000 times higher than the public
        health alert level.
        - There was no evidence that the leak had reached public wells, but
        nearby private wells were heavily contaminated and could no longer be
        used.
        - A study by the San Francisco-based Citizens for a Better Environment
        found that at least 38 Santa Clara County firms store hazardous
        chemicals underground. They call on state health officials to take
        action on the nine Silicon Valley tanks found to be leaking.
        - CBE calls for a statewide audit to identify underground tanks
        storing potentially hazardous material; to order firms to regularly
        check such tanks and the soil and water around them; to design
        standards for new tanks and upgrade existing tanks; formulate an
        evaluation plan for chronic public health problems with underground
        water contamination.
        - Signetics Corp. was under pressure to identify the scope of its leak
        that led Sunnyvale to shut down three wells.
    - "New chemical leaks found in Sunnyvale, PA," no source but probably SJMN, March 5, no year
        - Reports of new leaks in Palo Alto and Sunnyvale.
        - Advanced Micro Devices Inc (915 DeGuigne Drive, Sunnyvale)
        discovered contaminated soil near the plant.
        - Hewlett-Packard reported a leak to the regional water quality
        control board, the third reported leak at an HP facility in Palo Alto.
        - Sunnyvale shut down the three wells near Advanced Micro Devices on
        Feb. 18 in response to reports of a chemical leak at Signetics (811 E.
        Arques Ave).
        - Palo Alto gets all its drinking water from Hetch Hetchy, and is not
        affected by the leaks.

### Folder 3

- Letter from Smith to Mineta, Jul 23, 1984
    - Smith is asking Mineta to strengthen HR 5640 by adding two amendments:
        - amend Title IV with design standards to prevent further underground
        storage leaks. (1)
        - redefine "imminent hazard" to authorize the release of emergency
        funds "whenever drinking water wells are closed due to toxic
        contamination." (1)
    - Passes along information that the RWQCB found 80% of the tested
    underground tanks were leaking. (1)
    - "Our entire drinking water aquifer, which supplies over one million
    people, is now in jeopardy." (1)
    - Says SVTC was "instrumental in writing and securing adoption of a Model
    Hazardous Materials Storage Ordinance" at the local level then throughout
    California. Some of the key features of the legislation are design
    standards and strict monitoring. (1)
    - Smith suggests that although HR 5640 contains the Durenberger amendment
    to Title IV, he feels those provisions could be substantially strengthened
    by "incorporating our model design standards for secondary containment and
    monitoring *in addition to* the present performance standards." (2;
    emphasis original)
    - The SVTC plan calls for all new construction to use secondary
    containment around both tanks and connecting joints and pipes ("which have
    often been the source of the problem") along with a monitoring system to
    detect leaks from the primary container that would set off a warning
    system. There is no retrofit plan because of the expense, but strict
    monitoring provisions to provide early detection of leaks. (2)
    - At the time of this letter, "not a single site has been listed by the
    EPA as a superfund site (two have been proposed for listing)." SVTC made
    an appeal for emergency cleanup through the "imminent hazard" provisions
    of superfund but were informed by EPA that they did not qualify. (2)
    - Smith argues that the "imminent hazard" provision should be redefined to
    include automatic definition any time a drinking well must be shut down.
    Then emergency funds would become available immediately. The closure of a
    drinking well should also make a site an automatic qualifier for the
    National Priority List under superfund. (2)
- Letter from Mineta to Ruckelshaus, Aug 7 1984
    - Mineta is writing to Ruckelshaus and Carole A. Onorato, chairwoman of
    the California State Water Resources Control Board.
    - Mineta writes to "express our extreme concern over the growing problem
    of hazardous waste leaks in Santa Clara County." Mineta argues that the
    widespread presence of leaks threatens the health of "several hundred
    thousand local residents" and calls for "immediate action" to "place the
    entire Santa Clara Valley on the Superfund National Priority List." (1)
    - Over 120 leaks had been discovered so far in Santa Clara. "The sources
    and spread of these leaks have proven difficult to locate, and numerous
    unmapped plumes of contaminants have continued to spread unchecked through
    the ground around the local aquifer system." Mineta argues that despite
    the collaboration between federal, state, and local officials to confront
    the problem, "we believe that effective action cannot begin without
    Superfund assistance. The cost of clean up is simply too great, and time
    is too short, to rely solely on local and state agencies." (1)
    - Mineta argues that a "site-by-site approach" for listing sites on the
    National Priority List is "ineffective."
- Letter from Ayres to Smith, Sept 20 1984
    - Responding to Smith's request that the EPA take immediate action on the
    Bay Area's contamination. This results from a meeting Smith apparently had
    with Ruckelshaus on or around June 9. Ayres is responding point-by-point.
    - **See the "Action Proposals" SVTC mailer in this folder", which outlines
    the below points.**
    - "EPA Cleanup all 120 Spill Sites in Our Community"
        - As background: under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
        Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) the EPA can take
        "emergency or remedial response actions whenever any hazardous
        substance is released or there is a substantial threat of such a
        release into the environment." *Emergency actions* are initiated when
        there's an immediate risk to public health, welfare, or environment,
        and limited by a \$1 million ceiling and 6 month response period.
        *Remedial actions* are taken when a site is listed on the National
        Priority List and require more time for investigation and cleanup.
        The sites on NPL are eligible for Superfund funding but not guaranteed
        funding. (1)
        - The EPA initiated an intensive effort to study South Bay sites for
        inclusion on NPL and make them eligible for funding, possibly listing
        15-20 new sites for the NPL. Ayres expects that Region 9 (designiation
        for the EPA office in San Francisco?) expects to receive \250,000 to
        conduct planning at South Bay sites to develop the "technical and
        financial information to support future funding requests." (2)
        - Once the sites appear on the NPL, the EPA will "consider entering
        into a cooperative agreement with the State to provide direct funding
        support" to the RWQCB and "assist them in site investigations and
        cleanup at active and abandoned facilities." (2)
    - "EPA Sue Companies for Cleanup Cost - Not Charge Taxpayers"
        - The EPA has the authority under CERCLA to sue responsible parties to
        compel cleanup and recover federal funds. If the EPA orders
        responsible parties to cleanup a site, it is authorized to recover
        damages. The "EPA will use this authority if necessary." (2)
    - "EPA Relocate Affected Residents Who Request Assistance"
        - The EPA had only relocated residents in three cases, all involving
        soils contaminated with dioxin and asbestos. But there have not been
        any cases where people were relocated because of drinking water. Since
        the cost of relocation is high on both the disruption of the
        community and on the Hazardous Substances Trust Fund, the EPA will
        provide alternative sources of drinking water instead. (2)
    - "EPA Provide Medical Screening for Residents Near Toxic Sites; Provide
    Medical Care for Toxic Victims in Need"
        - "The EPA does not have the authority under CERCLA to provide medical
        care to victims of hazardous waste sites." However, the EPA did ask
        the Center for Disease Control on July 26, 1984, to investigate
        providing these needs under the Public Health Service Act. (3)
    - "EPA Test the Air in Spill Site Areas"
        - The EPA says it will conduct limited air testing at South Bay sites
        that qualify for NPL.
    - "EPA Test Tap Water in Spill Site Areas"
        - EPA held a pubic meeting on August 16, 1984.
        - They indicated at this meeting that the EPA is sampling at the
        wellhead and tap in certain areas in the South Bay determined by both
        the EPA and the community.
    - "EPA Meet With Our Leaders for "Right-to-Know" Meetings; Recognize Our
    Group as Official Community Representatives; and Agree to Meet Again
    Within 90 Days for a Progress Report"
        - EPA attended a public meeting on July 3, 1984.
        - At that meeting, the EPA agreed to recognize SVTC as the official
        representative of the community.
- Letter from Mineta to Smith, Oct 25, 1984
    - Mineta informs Smith that Ruckelshaus proposed adding 20 toxic sites in
    Santa Clara County to the Superfund National Priority List. Nineteen of
    the sites are associated with the electronics industry. (1)
    - Mineta is concerned that the listing of these sites may divert attention
    from other leaks. "The 19 sites proposed for listing are only slightly
    more than one fifth of the 89 confirmed leaks already identified, and
    obviously a much smaller portion of the hundreds more sites that EPA and
    other agencies expect to find as the search for leaks continue." (1)
    - Mineta supports revisions to the Superfund program and reports that the
    House adopted two revisions:
        - require the EPA to give "high priority" to all Superfund decisions
        resulting in the contamination of and closing of drinking wells. (1)
        - mandate tanks with double containment measures (based on Santa Clara
        County's Model Ordinance). (1)
    - The House passed the Superfund bill on August 10, 1984, with Mineta's
    amendments, but the legislation did not pass the Senate due to
    "Administration opposition." He plans to renew the legislation during the
    99th Congress.
    - Two of Mineta's proposals did pass Congress and is waiting presidential
    action; those proposals to the Hazardous Waste Control and Enforcement Act
    makes it explicit that no state can adopt hazardous waste rules less
    stringent than federal guidelines; and to clarify tank standards and
    underground pipes.
    - Investigators from the House Committee on Public Works and
    Transportation have begun to investigate the toxic waste problems in Santa
    Clara county.
- "Action Proposals," SVTC, n.d.
- "Groundwater Toxics Crisis in Silicon Valley," SVTC, Press
Conference and Emergency Meeting,
    - "Our experience has clearly demonstrated that local and state agencies
    simply do not have sufficient resources to solve -- much less control --
    our toxics crisis, particularly in those cases where industry fails to
    cooperate. In spite of this fact, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
    and Superfund have failed to provide any funds for cleanup." (1)
    - SVTC critical of the EPA's action so far, which has agreed to do an
    Integraded Environmental Mangement Program to study the crisis. Ted Smith,
    Peter Cervantes-Gautschi, and Mike Belliveau sit on the Public Advisory
    Committee of the project. (2)
- "No More Poison In Our Water" flier
    - Flier from SVTC
    - Calls for "Signetics, AMD & TRW to clean up their toxic mess
    immediately. For two years, these companies have refused to act
    responsibly to protect this neighborhood. We now demand that EPA and the
    Regional Water Board step in to protect us and our children from these
    companies."
    - "Don't Let Industry Do its Business in our Water!!!"
    - An article photocopied onto the flier:
        - "Sunnyvale toxic leak poses threat"
            - Reports on a two year leak at Sunnyvale that potentially spread
            into private wells and threatens municipal water supplies.
            - The leak was spreading TCE into shallow ground water wells near
            Signetics Inc.
            - Donald Dalke, chief of the San Francisco Bay RWQCB: "It appears
            that contaminants have . . . migrated into a major residential
            area north of Duane Avenue."
            - The EPA says TCE can cause damange to liver and the central
            nervous and cardiovascular systems in humans. Santa Clara County
            has set 5 parts per billion as the level in which cleanup action
            must begin. Test wells have indicated that levels of TCE found at
            1,800 parts per billion.
            - Another leak was discovered in Mountain View, where it was found
            TCE, dichloroethylene, and trichloroethane were found in 12 to 18
            residential wells tested. Around 100 residents were warned not to
            drink water from private wells.
            - Water and health officials fear that the Sunnyvale leak may
            percolate through shallow groundwater into deeper groundwater
            where the city's municipal supply comes from.
            - Officials knew of the leak two years ago, and the regional water
            board ordered Signetics to excavate the chemical storage tank
            where the leak was discovered. Signetics disposed the tank and
            soil offsite. TCE levels then were found at 890,000 parts per
            billion in water nearby. Yet much TCE remained in the soil and
            spread toward residential areas.
            - The water board had negotiated with Signetics for two years to
            clean up the site. Donald Dalke wrote in a May 21 letter that "As
            of today, we have not seen any effort by (Signetics) to prevent
            further . . . migration, nor has there been any attempt to reduce
            the concentration of contaminants under Signetics property."
- "Superfund Briefing" document
- William Ruckelshaus speech, "Environmental Protection: Politics and
Reality," Oct 26, 1984
    - Ruckelshaus is presenting to the Commonwealth Club of California in San
    Francisco, October 26, 1984
    - "Some of the strangest bedfellows in all politics are found together on
    environmental issues---people with patches on their sleeves and shoulders
    who shoot ducks joined with people who grow pot and live on bean sprouts.
    And, with few exceptions, the environmental battles played out in the
    national political arena have been non-partisan in nature, consistent with
    this broad and eclectic public support." (2)
    - "We may ask why the environment has emerged more recently as a partisan
    issue, and what are the implications of that change. First of all, I
    think, the environmental problems of the present are both more frightening
    and more difficult to understand than those of the past. This situation
    arises from the insidious and apparently universal presence of toxic
    chemicals in our environment, chemicals that have been associated with
    dreaded diseases." (3)
    - The Santa Clara County is "a novel problem" because "it does not involve
    waste products of the sort that we have typically controlled as
    pollutants. Instead, the tanks in question contain virgin chemicals, most
    often the solvents used in building computers." (9)
    - "about half of the 1.4 million people in the Valley drink at least some
    ground water. To date, 13 public water supply wells have been contaminated
    with solvents. The Mountain View area has been particularly hard-hit,
    with 46 private wells shut down." (9)
    - Industry responded well, spending $70 million to drill monitoring wells,
    contain plumes, clean up ground water, and replace leaking tanks. (9--10)
    - The California Regional Water Quality Control Board moved to detect
    contamination over the past three years, finding about 90 sites, sixteen
    of which have cleanup operations underway. Many of the municipalities
    passed a Hazardous Materials Management Ordinance to regulate storage and
    handling of toxics. (10)

### Folder F 3 2 of 4

- EPA Superfund factsheet
    - "South Bay Ground Water Contamination: An Overview"
    - Water for South Bay residents comes from three sources: ground water,
    local surface water, and surface water imported through the South Bay and
    Hetch Hetchy Aqueducts. Groundwater supplies more than one-half of the
    drinking water in the Valley. (1)
    - 10 municipal agencies and 9 private water companies distribute water to
    residents, operating around 300 wells. Another 5,000 private wells serve
    individual households and businesses. (1)
    - There are two aquifers in Santa Clara Valley: a shallow aquifer, which
    most private wells draw on, and a lower aquifer, where public wells draw
    from. A layer of clay 100 to 200 feet below ground separates the aquifers,
    but breaks in the lay (from those wells that were improperly constructed
    or abandoned) have let possible contaminants reach the lower aquifer.
    There are 10,000 abandoned wells in the Valley. (1)
    - As of January 1985, 126 industrial sites were investigated for leaks and
    99 were ongoing cleanups; 19 were categorized "no further action needed";
    and sixteen categorized "no contamination." (2)
    - Contaminants have been discovered in 19 public wells and 43 private
    wells. (2)
    - 35 private wells in the Mountain View area were closed in July 1984.
    Eight private wells in South San Jose were found to contain chemicals,
    three of which closed down. (2)
    - "No wells currently drawing from the deep aquifer are known to be
    cotaminated, and no public water supply system is delivering water
    exceeding 3 parts per billion (ppb) of trichloroethane (TCA) or 3.5 ppb of
    Freon 113. The State Action Level of TCA is 200 ppb, and no State Action
    Level has been established for Freon 113." (3)

    contaminated by organic solvents.
    - Janet Hayes asked for the tests to be conducted in order to determine
    the possible problems with contamination. John Gaston, the state health
    official responsible for water purity, said: "I think that we will find
    that there is no a widespread problem."

- "Chemical leak gets it first test tonight" *San Jose Mercury* February 3,
1983
    - The Intergovernmental Council composed of representatives from 15 cities
    and the county and public agencies will consider an ordinance requiring
    the monitor of chemical-storage containers. Although their vote is only
    advisory, supporters believe it's the first step toward getting cities to
    adopt the ordinance.
        - Referring here to the Model Ordinance
    - Larry Stone, chairman of the council: "[Water contamination] is the No.
    1 issue facing the county. It is a serious problem; it's acknowledged to
    be a problem by industry. That, plus the number of leaks that have
    occurred, have put it on people's minds."
    - Industry is pushing against the requirement that companies report the
    storage of chemicals in quantities under 55 gallons.
    - Much of the opposition comes from the petroleum industry, arguing that
    standards "would put some service station owners out of business." Paul
    Hay, executive director of the Northern California Petroleum Retailers
    Association: "I see this as a tax, and if we're going to put on a tax, we
    should take it to the public."
    - SVTC, "a loosely woven alliance of about 50 health, environmental and
    labor groups that was formed last summer," had three main changes they
    proposed to the model ordinance:
        - legal protection for whistle-blowers
        - required reporting of storage of all quantities of known carcinogens
        as defined in Cal-OSHA's list of 22 substances.
        - required reporting of an additional number of chemicals on
        Cal-OSHA's list of hazardous substances.
- "Don't Go Near the Water," KCBS Radio editorial

    water laced with trichloroethylene, xylene, perchloroethylene, benzene,
    acetone or a host of dangerous solvents."
    - Notes that last year Great Oaks shut down a quarter of its wells, and
    people in the area claim their community has birth defects, stillbirths,
    and other serious health problems.

    - Fairchild announced that it and other companies (Great Oaks Water
    Company, IBM, and several others involved in the design and manufacture of
    Fairchild's underground tanks) agreed to pay a multimillion dollar settlement
    to 530 residents in South San Jose.
    - No specific terms of the settlement were revealed.
    - John Tyndall, an attorney representing some of the residents, described
    the agreement as "multimillion-dollar" and "far more of a significant
    settlement in terms of what the people are actually getting" than the Love
    Canal lawsuit in New York.
    - Tyndall charged that Fairchild installed a tank incompatible with toxic
    wastes that allowed the toxics to leak or eat their way through the tank.
    - Fairchild has spent more than $25 million in cleanup at the South San
    Jose site, and the plant has been for sale since 1983 (a spokeswoman
    claims it's because the company developed a manufacturing center at
    Puyallup, Wash.)
    - Since the lawsuit was filed, three children and two adults died of
    cancer. Residents reported another 60 miscarriages and 17 cases of major
    cardiac birth defects.
    - State health studies, however, never linked the high rates of birth
    defects to the contaminated rinking water (at least, not as of 1985).
- "EPA explains what it's doing," *Times Tribune* August 17, 1984
    - I need to nail down which *Times Tribune* this is.
    - 250 people in attendance at San Jose High School to hear what the EPA is
    doing to clean up toxic chemicals. Residents accuse the EPA of being too
    slow in its response.
    - Barbara Fenster, residents living near IBM in San Jose where water has
    been contaminated: "EPA stands for Environmental Protection Agency. I'd be
    glad to know what part of the valley the EPA protects, because it sure
    isn't drinking water."
    - Michael Belliveau claims that the EPA has known about toxic
    contamination in the valley since 1979 but waited until 1984 to begin
    requiring cleanup of toxic chemicals.
    - The EPA has proposed that between 13 and 20 sites in Santa Clara will be
    eligible for Superfund money.
    - The San Francisco Regional office called on the EPA to consider the
    sites from Palo Alto to San Jose as a single, large toxic site rather than
    individual sites to be cleaned up separately.
    - The EPA also called on the CDC to study residents of neighborhoods were
    water has been contaminated. The CDC has expressed interest, but needs
    more information from the EPA and State Department of Health Services.
    - Ted Smith says the EPA's decision to include the Valley for Superfund
    funding is a "good first step--but only a drop in the bucket."
    - SVTC called on the EPA to take these actions:
        - notify the community and workers in industry when toxic contaminants
        have been found their homes or work and the health risks associated
        with contamination.
        - test tap water (instead of well water) for toxic contamination
        - require immediate cleanup of toxic spills with specific deadlines
        - health screening for victims exposed to toxic chemicals at work or
        in their drinking water
- "Waste Sites on Coast Debated," *New York Times* August 19, 1984
    - First national story on the county's toxic problems
    - Reporting that the EPA has been asked to add 20 sites to "the list of
    the nation's worst hazardous waste sites."
    - In a letter from Norman Mineta to William Ruckelshaus, Mineta asked that
    the entire area be placed on the list of sites to be cleaned up by the EPA
    and claimed a site-by-site cleanup would be ineffective. Quoting the
    letter: "Plumes of contaminants continue to spread unchecked through the
    ground of local aquifer systems." The letter was also signed by Don
    Edwards and Ed Zshau.
- "Underground Pollution in Silicon Valley Widespread, Federal Officials
Report," *Wall Street Journal* November 14, 1984
    - Look this up; my photograph of this is too blurry to make out.
- "State Health Department Releases Fairchild Studies," Department of Health
Services *News News*, January 16, 1985
    - The first study showed a "2.4 times higher rate of miscarriages and a threefold
    increase in total birth defects in the community of Los Paseos compared to
    a nearby community which has had no known water contamination and which is
    demographically similar to Los Paseos." (1)
    - A second study showed "a two and a half times higher rate of major heart
    defects in the study area compared to the rest of the county during 1981."
    (1)
    - The study concluded:
        - There was an excess of miscarriages, congenital heart abnormalities,
        and total birth defects in the community near Fairchild in 1980 and
        1981. (1)
        - The increase in health problems are not due to behavior, habits, or
        "known characteristics of the mothers" (age, smoking, alcohol,
        medications, ethnicity, occupation, etc) (1)
        - The cause of "adverse pregnancy outcomes are unknown; contaminated
        drinking water cannot be ruled out as a contributing cause at this
        time." (1)
    - Dr. Kizer says that the reason they cannot conclusively link
    contamination with health problems is because drinking water was never
    monitored for TCA, DCE, or other contaminants during the 18 month study.
    Furthermore, the geographic distribution of the cases found many babies
    with health problems were born to mothers living in areas unlikely
    affected by contaminated water.
    - Because of a lack of data on infectious agents or possible toxic air,
    Dr. Kizer says "it is impossible to know exactly which mothers were
    exposed to what and, if so, how much." Plus, TCA and DCE are "not known to
    cause birth defects or miscarriages in the concentrations detected." (2)
    - The Fairchild storage tank was located 2,000 feet from the Great Oaks
    well. TCA and DCE were found in the well at many times the concentrations
    allowed by state law.
    - The first study found that among women between 1980 and 1981 in the Los
    Paseos neighborhood, 21.5% had a spontaneous abortion rate compared to 11%
    in the control census tract. (4)
    - "A total of 12 cases of major cardiac defects was found in the study
    area. Of note, no discernible pattern in the types of defects was found,
    nor was there an excess of minor heart defects." (4)
    - "The role of the groundwater contamination by TCA, DCE and other
    solvents in explaining the findings of these studies is not clear." (4)
    - Data "suggests that the leak [at Fairchild] began in 1980, increased in
    the second half of 1980 and peaked at the end of 1981." (4)
    - The State Department of Health Services plans to continue studying the
    incident, and Governor Deukmejian proposed funding for the investigation
    in the 1985-1986 Budget.
- "Threats to drinking water supplies," *San Jose Mercury News* February 14,
1985
    - A report by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board
    found that Solvent Service, a solvent recycling plant in San Jose, "poses
    the most serious pollution threat to drinking water supplies among 46
    sites in San Jose."
    - The RWQCB studied 46 sites, identifying 7 in San Jose, 18 in Santa
    Clara, and 21 in Sunnyvale as the most threatening.
    - The seven sites in San Jose were Solvent Service, IBM Corp., Fairchild
    Camera and Instrument, Van Waters & Rogers, and Pacific Nursery.
    - See the table here: 46 contaminated sites ranked in terms of their
    threat to drinking water; companies and businesses.
- "State won't punish IBM for toxic leak," *San Jose Mercury News* February
21, 1985
    - The state water pollution board decided against asking the state
    attorney general to prosecute IBM for discharging toxic chemicals at the
    South San Jose plant.
    - The Board voted 4-3 that the seven-year leak at IBM's Cottle Road plant
    did not warrant action by the state.
    - IBM had spent $34 million on cleanup and preventative measures since the
    leak was first discovered in 1978.
    - Board members voting against IBM were Marion Otesa and Donald Anderson.
    - Michael Belliveau agreed with Otesa and Anderson, saying that
    contamination by a chemical that is a "known mutagen" and "suspected
    carcinogen" should "be sufficient to trigger an enforcement action."
- "IBM leak decision criticized," *San Jose Mercury News* February 22, 1985
    - Environmentalists are suggesting that the decision by the state water
    board to not file legal action against IBM is the wrong course of action.
    - Ted Smith: "Here we have a state agency telling the largest computer
    company in the world with one of the largest toxic waste spills in the
    world that it will not have to pay any penalties. That's the wrong message
    to get out."
- "Clean up now, argue later," *San Jose Mercury* April 28, 1985
    - "Of the 19 Santa Clara county toxic contamination sites on the federal
    EPA Superfund list, three are intertwined neighbors in north Mountain View
    near the intersection of Middlefield Road with Whisman and Ellis
    Streets."
    - Roger James, head of the RWQCB: "The initial investigation began over
    three years ago and yet the plume (of contamination) has not been fully
    defined or contained."
    - The issues surrounding the contamination is complicated because
    individual companies have different ideas about how to approach the
    cleanup. The *Mercury News* editorializes that "voluntary effort is
    preferable. But in this case, responsibility, the extent of the
    contamination, and even the pattern of underground aquifers are still
    unclear after three years. Contamination has spread past the property of
    any one company and mixed together. Chemicals may be flowing from one
    aquifer to another through private wells."
    - The *Merucry News* suggests that in places where no single company is
    obviously responsible or is unwilling to do what is needed, Superfund
    should "step in to get the cleanup moving now. Money spent can be
    recovered in court later, when the responsibility is apportioned."

Inc./Advanced Micro Devices Superfund Sites"
    - An opportunity for public comment mailer from the Regional Water Quality
    Control Board to be held at Fairwood Elementary School Cafeteria in
    Sunnyvale
    - The Regional Board is requiring National and AMD to "cleanup groundwater
    in the vicinity of their facilities in Santa Clara. The companies have
    submitted reports descriping a number of cleanup alternatives. The
    Regional Board staff has developed a Proposed Final Cleanup Plan adapted
    from reports submitted by the companies." (1)
- "Environmental News Fact Sheet: Status Report, South Bay Tapwater Sampling
Program," November 5, 1984
    - These are preliminary results of tapwater samples. Early results
    indicate that two of the ten homes sampled had trace contaminants of TCA
    and 1,1-DCE. The TCA home was at Clear Park Place, and the DCE sample was
    at Park Arcadia. Samples collected by Great Oaks did not show
    contamination. (1)
    - The water supply for the Clear Park Place comes from San Jose Water
    Company wells in the area. (2)
- "County residents concerned about water quality, poll says," *San Jose
Business Journal*," November 25, 1985
    - A poll by the Bay Area Council finds Santa Clara County residents more
    concerned about drinking water than any other part of the Bay Area. 77% of
    county residents said water quality had gotten worse, compared to 48%
    throughout the Bay Area.
    - "Regionally, Santa Clara County stands out as the area with the greatest
    amount of support for the importance of air and water quality standards,
    even if it means a reduction in new jobs and industry, according to poll
    results."
    - "Overall, pollution was recognized as the second most important problem
    facing the bay area. Transportation was named the primary problem in this
    county and overall."
    - The poll also indicates that Santa Clara County residents are less
    supportive of growth than they had previously been; **is this evidence of
    the anti-growth politics?**

    - The leak is located near the Andersn Reservoir. "The potential for
    contamination of this reservoir is of great concern to this District Board
    and the area residents and I know that the Board of Supervisors shares
    that concern." (1)
    - Diridon's planning department is reviewing a discharge permit for United
    Technologies, and Judge asks Diridon to "carefully review this permit in
    light of the recently developed County Hazardous Waste Management Plan
    provisions for storage and handling of hazardous waste in watershed
    areas." (1)

    - "Citizen Success Story #1: Silicon Valley, California"
        - When the Fairchild leak was discovered in 1982, residents began
        organizing with the help of SCCOSH. As residents began organizing,
        local and regional government began to respond as well. The RWQCB
        started a leak detection program while the local fire chief's
        association launched a campaign to create a model ordinance. (330)
        - A letter circulated to "community groups and individuals" laid out
        the origins of the SVTC:
            - "...we believe now is the time to pull together a coalition to
            further organize around these issues. In recent discussions with
            representatives from labor, health, environmental and community
            organizations and groups, it has been clear that such a coalition
            is not only *essential* but it is *feasible* to get off the ground
            in the immediate future. . . . We proposed the name SILICON VALLEY
            TOXICS COALITION, the long-term goal of which would be to maintain
            our communities and workplaces free from toxic contamination"
            (emphasis original; quoted, 331)

* Silicon Valley Toxics News (April 1985)
    * Michael Belliveau, "High Tech Firms Fiddle While Spill Spreads"
        * Mountain View passed a resolution on April 9, 1985, urging the state
        to take action against five high-tech firms responsible for
        threatening the city's drinking water supply. (1)
        * The contamination leak was discovered three years earlier (1982) and
        high levels of TCE, TCA, DCE, DCA, and PCEW have been found at depths
        of 100 feet. Groundwater supplies 13% of Mountain View's drinking
        water.
    * Susie Wilson, "Safe Water Council Moves on Solutions"
        * Notes that the County Health Department has "still not fully
        recovered from the budget cuts imposed as a result of Proposition 13."
        **What is this about?**
    * Ted Smith, "The P.R. Is High Tech---Clean-up Is Low Priority"
        * The Industry Clean Water Task Force presented a study on February 14,
        1985, "Status Report on Clean-up Progress at 82 Sites in Santa Clara
        County" to the South Bay Ground Water Task Force. (2)
        * Smith challenges the view of the study's conclusion that "voluntary
        cooperation" in clean-up is working. (Smith quoting the report) (2)
        * A San Jose City Council review presented on March 19, 1985, reports
        that: "The majority of leaks and spills are now discovered during
        enforcement of the Hazardous Materials Ordinance. Since the deadline
        for installing monitoring systems for underground tanks has not yet
        passed, we estimate that only 10% of the potential underground leaks
        have so far been discovered." (quoted, 2)
        * Smith blames the slow progress partially on the economic realities
        of the semiconductor industry. He argues that "a company that commits
        significant resources to a clean-up operation runs the risk that the
        money managers will sell off its stock, thereby depressing its value."
        (2)
        * To fix the issue, Smith argues for "a unified, coherent and
        aggressive governmental response---with adequate funding---to set
        rigid but realistic goals and timetables for clean-up
        operations---with the capacity and will to take strong enforcement
        actions against companies which fail to meet those goals and
        timetables. Continued community concern and pressure is our best hope
        for assuring this response." (2)
    * Lorraine Ross, "State Study Confirms Birth Defect Cluster"
        * Talking of "The Fairchild Leak". (3)
        * "Shocked into the reality that high tech was not 'Clean Industry'
        and not immune to the need for regulation and safeguards, politicans
        and health officials have had to yield to public pressure. The
        Fairchild Leak generated many important issues, none more important
        that the connection between contaminated water and a neighborhood
        plagued with birth and health problems." (3)
        * Lorraine published an essay in the *Mercury News*, which found its
        way on the front page of the paper on February 2, 1982. Week later,
        she handed over a list of seventy-two people who telephoned her with
        reports about their own birth defects and health problems. (3)
        * Lorraine challenges the County's use of birth certificate records
        for Los Paseos, arguing that the information she provided "was a
        fairer accounting of what was happening in our area than the birth
        certificates." (3)
        * The County aquiesced to community pressure and formed the Santa
        Clara County Health Advisory Committee on Environmental Teratology in
        and held its first meeting in March 1982, where it agreed there was
        enough evidence to start an investigation. The investigation started
        in Fall 1982, stopped in December 1982 because of a lack of funding,
        and started again thanks to some funding from the EPA. The study was
        released on January 16, 1985, and confirmed that a birth defect
        cluster existed in Los Paseos. The study also announced a $825,000
        addition to the State budget for further study. (3)
        * "The people of this area remain the innocent bystandards...innocent
        victims of a monumental ecological disaster in this state." (3)
        * "We are left with merely a heightened awareness of the fragility of
        our environment and a need to seek more answers to more questions."
        (3)
    * "Lorentz SCALPed"
        * A toxic cloud released on the evening of Feb. 13 at Lorentz Barrel
        and Drum Company in San Jose. Students at San Jose State University
        organized a Students and Community Against Lorentz Pollution (SCALP)
        that successfully shut down Lorena (from a temporary injunction by
        Deputy District Attorney Jerome Nadler). (6)
    * "IBM Markets New Product---'Acceptable Risk'"
        * Critical of the RWQCB's decision to not charge IBM for contamination
        of water at its South San Jose plant. Article criticizes the adoption
        of "'acceptable risk' approach to toxics clean-up." (8)
        * SVTC members argued at a public hearing a week before Christmas 1984
        that IBM failed to investigate the use of carbon treatment of affected
        wells and that the state's Nondegradation Policy called for the
        "maximum feasible restoration of polluted waters." Their position
        shared wide support with the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors,
        the San Jose City Council, and the Santa Clara Valley Water District.
        (8)
            * More evidence of just how complicated and fragmented the politics
            are around this stuff.
        * Despite widespread support, the Regional Board voted 6-1 to grant
        relief to IBM and voted 4-3 not to fine IBM for extensive groundwater
        pollution. (8)
* Letter from John Vasconcellos to George Deukmejian, February 22, 1985
    * Vasconcellos writing to the Governor to "bring to your attention a
    serious problem within the Department of Health Services involving the
    release of incomplete information on the potential health risks associated
    with the toxic chemical 1,1,1 trichloroethane (TCA)." (1)
    * On Dec. 18, 1984, the Bay Area RWQCB approved a cleanup plan for IBM
    that permitted "low levels of the toxic chemical (TCA) to remain in an
    underground source of drinking water." Their decision was based "on
    testimony presented by the Department of Health Services." (1)
    * Vasconcellos argues the Health Department was not qualified to serve as
    expert testimony by failing to "present a complete picture of the
    potential health risks associated with TCA." (1)
        * The Health Department argues that low levels of TCA (less than 5ppb)
        is safe, but if TCA is found to be a carcinogen then state health
        policies mean no exposure to TCA is "safe."
        * The Health Department never mentioned its study of pregnancy
        problems in Los Paseos, which was "unable to rule out the possibility
        that TCA might have been a factor in the excess rate of birth defects
        and miscarriages around the Fairchild site." (1)
        * The Health Department never mentioned results of a recent study
        about TCA's effects "on fetal cardiovascular development in rats. This
        study found a significant increase in cardiac abnoramlities of
        offspring following administration of TCA in drinking water." (2)
    * Vasconcellos urges the Governor to "direct the Department to immediately
    prepare a complete evaluation of what is known and not known about the
    long-term health effects of TCA and to advise the State and Regional Water
    Boards of your findings." (2)
* Letter from John Vasconcellos to Toxics Budget Task Force, Sept. 18, 1985
    * SB 1063 passed on the last day of 1985 legislative session by Senator
    Presley, appropriating $16 million to cleanup the Stringfellow Acid Pits;
    $1.4 million to install carbon filters in the San Cabriel Valley; $4
    million to establish an Emergency Safe Drinking Water Fund; and $3.6
    million to accelerate the cleanup of leaking underground storage tanks.
    * Vasconcellos says the Governor vetoed all new underground tank funds
    from the 1985-1986 budget and is urging they make their support of SB 1063
    clear to the Governor. (1)
* Letter from Dominic Cortese to Ted Smith, May 3, 1985
    * Cortese writing that he introduced AB 2536 based on the Santa Clara
    County Safe Water Council's recommendations.
* Assembly Bill No. 2536
* Ted Smith and Mike Belliveau, "Responsible action needed in IBM's toxic waste cleanup," *San Jose Business Journal* April 7, 1986
    * Reacting to the State Water Resources Control Board hearing an appeal by
    IBM after a cleanup order came from the Bay Area Regional Water Quality
    Control Board (ordered in Dec. 1984).
    * The IBM plant in South San Jose affected 25 public and private wells
    with chemicals and spread from the Cottle Road plant up to the San Jose
    Water Company's well field at Tully Road (five miles), "making this the
    largest known underground contamination problem in the area."
    * "The regional water quality control board in its December 1984 order
    ruled that IBM was not required to further define or decontaminate the
    polluted aquifers in the area north of Capitol and Monterey, despite the
    vigorous protests of the county, the City of San Jose, the Santa Clara
    Valley Water District, Citizens for a Better Environment, and the Silicon
    Valley Toxics Coalition."
* "Valley environment at a crossroad, experts say," *The Business Journal*
October 15, 1990
    * "The Santa Clara Valley might be the technological capital of the West,
    but that won't mean much if it does not find a way to clean up its air and
    water."
    * The article worries that without adopting mass transit and "other means,
    the area could become a mini-Los Angeles in terms of congestion and
    pollution."
        * LA was the model to strive for in the 1950. In the 1990s, it's to be
        avoided.
    * Story quotes Ted Smith that the area has more toxic gases stored
    throughout the county than any other place in the nation.
    * Teddy Morse, spokeswoman for the Santa Clara Water District, also notes
    the problem of water supply: "In 1989 we imported 90 percent of the water
    we supplied, and this year [1990] we imported 80 percent, and that has caused a
    problem for us." Imported water comes from the Sacramento-San Joaquin
    Delta, but contains farm runoff, salt water intrusion, and algae.
* "Ted Smith: Foes think he's anti-business, but fans say he's earth's
advocate," *The Business Journal* October 15, 1990
    * Smith: "The electronics industry is chemically dependent and we want to
    find ways to help it kick the habit." (12)
    * The biggest successes of SVTC were the local Right-to-Know and Materials
    Model Ordinances passed in 1983. The Right-to-Know ordinance required
    companies to report "extensive information on their hazardous materials."
    The state also used the Hazardous Materials Model ordinance as their model
    in a state-wide law a year later.
* Testimony of The Campaign for Responsible Technology (1992)
    * SVTC begins to expand its operations in the early 1990s. It reached out
    to other communities affected by toxic leaks and formed a national network
    called the Campaign for Responsible Technology (CRT). (2)
* come back to look at *The Legacy of High Tech Development* by Ted Smith (1992)
* Ted Smith, "Chief Seattle's Prophecy," probably 1990
    * The toxic leaks "shattered the 'clean industry' myth and made us realize
    that we had, indeed, contaminated our own bed." (1)
