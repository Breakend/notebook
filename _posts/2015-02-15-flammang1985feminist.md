p. 95: San Jose gained its reputation as "feminist capital of the nation" through the mayoral tenure of Janet Gray Hayes (1975--1982) and the female majorities on the San Jose City Council and Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors.

p. 95: Flammang's study draws on open-ended interviews she conducted in 1982 with Councilmember Blanca Alvarado, Supervisor Ron Diridon, Councilmember Nancy Ianni, Councilmember Shirley Lewis, Supervisor Zoe Lofgren, Councilmember Lu Ryden, Councilmember Pat Sausedo, and Supervisor Susanne Wilson.

p. 95: Santa Clara County had a "favorable political climate, effective women's organizations, and district elections. Confirming findings elsewhere, women were advantaged by an affluent, highly-educated and 'clean government' electorate, and by effective women's groups."

p. 96: San Jose was a self-proclaimed "feminist capital of the nation," first voiced at the 1974 meeting of the San Jose chapter of the National Women's Political Caucus following the election of Janet Gray Hayes to mayor, the election of Leona Egeland to the California Assembly, and the appointment of Geraldine Steinberg to the County Board of Supervisors.

p. 96: In 1978, Hayes was re-elected, Susanne Wilson won a seat at the county board, and Iola Williams was appointed to fill Wilson's seat in the City Council.

p. 96: After the 1980 elections, women were the majority on the city council (7-4) and the board of supervisors (3-2).

p. 96: Councilmember Nancy Ianni ran on an anti-growth platform.

p. 97: Female candidates benefitted from environmentalism and the post-Watergate desire for clean government.

p. 97: Environmental concerns stemmed from the decades of unplanned urban growth. Despite adding 40,000 new jobs pear year by 1980 and holding an unemployment rate below the state average, and a median income of $23,370 (the highest in the nation). But local services---sewers, parks, schools, libraries, streets, fire protection---could not keep up with the leapfrog annexations, traffic congenstion, and air pollution.

p. 97: "Among those championing the environment were many women homemakers and volunteers whose husbands held secure professional jobs. Because of the association in Santa Clara County between male candidates and the growth machines of a booster political elite, which had spearheaded the postwar economic boom that benefited developers, women were able to take leadership roles in environmental issues."

p. 97: Women were seen "as beyond the the developers' reach, and called for managed growth."

pp. 97-98: Five women joined Mayor Hayes and Councilmember Iola Williams on the San Jose City Council in 1980---Blanca Alvarado, Nancy Ianni, Shirley Lewis, Lu Ryden, and Pat Sausedo. Joining Susanne Wilson on the Board of Supervisors were Rebecca Morgan (replacing Geraldine Steinberg) and Zoe Lofgren.

p. 98: The women elected to office came from affluence, either holding their own positions (Morgan quit her job as vice-president at Bank of America to run; Ryden sold her talent agency; the other three were homemakers). Or their husbands worked in professional backgrounds that meant they could live off one income.

p. 98: The women were typically newcomers to politics; had older children; and were more likely Democrats than Republicans.

p. 98: Describes the political culture as one comfortable with risk-taking an a "can do" climate. Attributes some of this political culture to the mythos around Silicon Valley garage-to-riches stories.

p. 98: Santa Clara County has high levels of electoral engagement. In the "off-year" election of 1978 72% of voters came to the polls (above the 46% national average).

The role of political organizations:

- Zoe Lofgren and Rebecca Morgan had affiliations with law and business, respectively. (p. 99)
- Lu Ryden was reuited by the local Republican party. (p. 99)
- Janet Hayes was active with the Parent Teachers Association, League of Women Voters, American Association of University Women, and her neighborhood association. (Her first appearance before the city council was as a mother protesting the lack of traffic signs hear neighborhood schools.) (p. 99)
- Steinberg was a member of the State Bar Association and belonged to community and adolescent services boards, the LWV, and the National Women's Political Caucus. (p. 99)
- Wilson was active in California Elected Women's Association for Education and Research, the Democratic party, LWV, AAUW, and NWPC. (p. 99)
- Iola Williams active in school organizations. (p. 99)
- Pat Sausedo worked for neighborhood homeowners' group. (p. 99)
- Nancy Ianni was a former president of her neighborhood association and former LWV boardmember. (p. 99)

p. 100: Hayes' election was supported by NWPC. She won a narrow victory (1.3 percent of the vote) over former police officer Bart Collins, a pro-growth conservative.

p. 100: Also important to voter turnout is the concurrent holding of local elections with state and federal elections.

p. 100: Citing Trounstine and Christensen, who say that Hayes had the support of homeowner and neighborhood associations, environmentalists, and city's feminist organizations. They also suggest that the city's minority population supported her because they didn't want to see an ex-cop as mayor. (from their 1982 study, p. 104)

p. 101: Citing Troustine and Christensen that one official referred to female councilmembers as "housewives who get the political bug."

p. 103: The shift to district elections motivated more women to become involved in city politics, many who suggested they would not have run in a citywide election.

Councilmember Pat Sausedo was especially concerned about planning remaining open space in her neighborhood:

> District elections had a considerable effect on my decision to run this early. I was president of the homeowners association when the planning commission seat opened up and I went through the trauma of public interviews and got the appointment. I was on the commission two and one-half years. Without districting I would not have run so soon. I knew the district, and I knew increasingly more about the city from being on the planning commission. But I might not have run at all without districting. (p. 103)

p. 105: When Geraldine Steinberg joined the County Board she was dismissed by fellow members and not taken seriously.

Lu Ryden on the characterization of "housewives who got the political bug":

> I don't agree with that characterization, which makes it sound like women went straight from the apron in front of the stove into politics. These women were first activists in their neighborhoods who got frustrated and said, "Somebody has to do something and I will." Being a concerned housewife enabled them to get into neighborhood groups in the first place. (p. 110)
