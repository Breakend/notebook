p. 5: Quoting from journalist Bayard Taylor, arriving in California in 1849 from the east for Greeley's *New York Tribune*. Taylor saw the "vast and wonderful landscape" of the Santa Clara Valley. He wrote: "The soft, cloudless sky---the balmy atmosphere---the mountain ranges on either hand, stretching far before me until they vanished in a purple haze---the sealike sweep of the plain, with its islands and shores of dark-green oak, and the picturesque variety of animal life on all sides, combined to form a landscape which I may have seen equaled but never surpassed."^[Bayard Taylor, *Eldorado: Or Adventure in the Path of Empire* (New York: Alfred Knopf, 1973), 96.]

Bernard Reid came to California in 1849 on news of the gold strikes. He moved to San Francisco in 1850 before poverty sent him to Santa Clara, where he worked to help a farmer in his store and on his farm for one year.

p. 7: Letter from Bernard Reid, January 28, 1851:

- "now in a valley justly noted for its salubrity of climate" (7)
- writing from the mission in Santa Clara (7)
- Says Santa Clara "was far preferable to any spot I had before seen in California." (9)
- "There is no gradual rising and swelling of the plain into hill and mountain, such as we always see at home, so it is hard to tell where the one ends and the other begins; but the mountain starts up abruptly from the level greensward like a vast barrier intended by nature to defend the lovely Eden at its base." (11)
- Noting settlement: At Santa Clara, "there we see some sixty houses nearly all quite new and painted white. They have been built by the Americans within a year." (12)

p. 13: Letter from Reid, March 12, 1851, writing from Santa Clara:

- "this Italy and garden spot of All-America---of the singing birds, and the grassy sward, and balmy air, and the sunny sky . . ." (13)
- "Indeed the weather has been too cruelly fine for the farmers---if more rain had been mingled with the sunshine their prospects would be much better than they are at present." (14)
