Alfred E. Heller founded [California Tomorrow]() and served as its president from 1961 until 1974. A native of California and graduate of Stanford University, he was living in Nevada City and publishing the weekly *Nevada County Nugget* when he became involved in a grassroots platform to reroute freeway construction planned to cut through the middle of the town. He became a member of the California State Highway Commission in 1964. His experience during the freeway fight convinced him that the lack of integrated planning posted a threat to the state's future. He authored several articles of environmental problems, as well as co-authored *California Going, Going...* and *Phantom Cities of California* as well as edited *The California Tomorrow Plan*.
