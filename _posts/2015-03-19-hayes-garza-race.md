## Mayoral Race

Hayes opened her reelection campaign on March 9, 1978, citing her
leadership in bringing new jobs to the city while "maintaining balanced
urban growth."[^1]

Elections are slated for June 6.[^2] If no candidate gets more than 50
percent of the vote in June, a runoff election between the top two will
be held in November.[^3]

She claims Garza is "more pro-development" pointing to his support of
opening Coyote Valley to residential development, but was careful to
point out she was "much more restrained on growth than he is. . . . But
I'm not a no-growth advice."[^4]

Garza ran for mayor in 1974 also, but was beaten by Hayes.[^5] He also
ran to be vice-mayor, but Hayes beat him in that race as well.[^6]

She cites some of the problems she's working on in her announcement
speech: "We need plentiful and reasonably priced housing. We need to
complete the Highway 101 bypass, the West Valley Corridor and the
Guadalupe Expressway."[^7]

She cited her record of hiring 100 new police officers, a cut in city
property tax rates; creation of 20,000 new jobs; and recognition of San
Jose as the second most livable city in the West.[^8]

Five entered the race for mayor in 1978: Hayes; Garza; Claudette Begin;
John Russell; Ben Trevino.[^9]

Hayes sees housing as a problem for the city, not only the lack of good
affordable housing but the problem of the city providing most of the
county's housing: "We are providing housing for jobs in other cities.
They then get the cream of the economic development taxes."[^10] (Direct
quote)

Hayes points to her record in promoting "quality growth, balanced
growth," supporting the city's General Plan where it defined areas
intended for growth and where urban services are available.[^11]

Garza accuses Hayes of "talking out of both sides of her mouth" (direct
quote) in her actions such as supporting new apartment projects at King
and Tully, "ignoring" the need for parks, street improvements, and
industrial recruitment.[^12] Garza promises to deliver on recruiting
industry and jobs and improving city infrastructure.

John Russell: twenty-six year old Jeep salesman, primarily running
because councilman Jim Self dropped out of the race.[^13]

Ben Trevino: automobile salesman competing for his second mayoral
contest. "We should get rid of the weak people in our government because
they allow the federal people to come in here and start freeways and not
finish them.[^14]"

Claudette Begin: Socialist Workers Party candidate; slogan of "human
needs before profits." Secretary and cofounder of the Equal Rights
Coalition in Santa Clara County. Denounces discrimination in San Jose
government, especially towards women and Chicanos. She also points to
the environment: development should be undertaken "on the basis of what
people need."^["Five in crowded mayor's race," East San Jose Sun, May
24, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Janet Hayes Papers.]

The first mayoral debate was held on April 26 at San Jose State
University in a forum sponsored by the Chicano Business Students
Association.^["Garza on attack in mayor debate," *San Jose Mercury
News*, April 27, 1978.]

Despite Hayes' claim of being for limited growth, Garza cites her
approval of commercial development in the Evergreen district even
through the streets could not handle the traffic generated by
residential areas already there.^["Garza on attack in mayor debate,"
*San Jose Mercury News*, April 27, 1978.]

Both candidates opposed Prop 13. Hayes was more supportive of Prop 8
(the Behr bill). Approval of Prop 13 would mean cuts in support
services, said Hayes, and Garza suggested those cuts would be selective
and not reduce police or fire-fighting services.^["Garza on attack in
mayor debate," *San Jose Mercury News*, April 27, 1978.]

Outside the first mayoral debate a picket line for Gay Human Rights Week
protested controversy in the city council. The council had declared Gay
Pride Week, changed the name to Gay Human Rights Week, and when the
mayor and Garza changing their votes, rescinded the resolution
entirely.^["Garza on attack in mayor debate," *San Jose Mercury News*,
April 27, 1978.]

Hayes has endorsements from COPE, the UAW, the Teamsters, and the
National Women's Political Caucus.^["Difference is 'clear,' says mayor
of rival," *San Jose Mercury News*, May 12, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1,
Hayes Papers.]

The *News* (and *Mercury*) editorializes in favor of re-electing Hayes.
They argue that her support of "in-filling" (vs. sprawl), improving the
city tax base, supporting redevelopment, limiting city budget increases.
Although the paper thinks Garza has "good political instincts," he sees
"spending as a panacea for too many municipal problems." The paper
applauds her efforts at managing population growth by making "the most
efficient use of existing city services." They appreciate her support of
"in-filling" and using vacant land already serviced by streets, sewers,
and utilities.^["Re-elect the mayor," *San Jose News*, May 22, 1978,
Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

When the votes are cast come June 8 (67,149 for Hayes; 54,152 for Garza)
the vote is split enough about Hayes, Garza, and the other candidates
that the race is forced into a runoff.^["Anti-incumbent vote forces
mayoral, council runoffs," *San Jose Mercury*, June 8, 1978, Folder 13,
Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

Prop 13 passed in San Jose.^["Anti-incumbent vote forces
mayoral, council runoffs," *San Jose Mercury*, June 8, 1978, Folder 13,
Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

The *Mercury* finds in the runoff elections the forces of anti-incumbent
politics. They cite the performance of the John Russell mayoral
campaign, who took 6% of the vote despite spending no campaign money or
printed signs. The same held for Joe Colla, who joined the council in
1967 but despite supporting Prop 13 was forced into a runoff with Jerry
Estruth.^["Anti-incumbent vote forces mayoral, council runoffs,"
*San Jose Mercury*, June 8, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

Runoffs were also forced in the Santa Clara County supervisor spot
between Susanne Wilson and Ivan Zubow. Their campaign focused almost
entirely around land-use planning in the South Bay.^["Anti-incumbent
vote forces mayoral, council runoffs," *San Jose Mercury*, June 8, 1978,
Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

Susanne Wilson is a member of the city council.^["Anti-incumbent vote
forces mayoral, council runoffs," *San Jose Mercury*, June 8, 1978,
Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

Ivan Zubow is a land developer.^["Anti-incumbent vote forces mayoral,
council runoffs," *San Jose Mercury*, June 8, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1,
Hayes Papers.]

Wilson emphasized her voting record always focused on slow growth, but
Zubow says that isn't the case (similar sounding argument to Hayes and
Garza).^["Anti-incumbent vote forces mayoral, council runoffs,"
*San Jose Mercury*, June 8, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

A letter writing campaign by the Garza staff resulted in an uproar among
the media. Letters were mailed out claiming to be from neighborhood
homeowners organizations. Those around Alum Rock received letters from
"Eastside Citizens for Better Government," while those in Almaden
received letters from the "Willow Glen Homeowners for Better
Government." The letters failed to note they were paid for by the Garza
for Mayor Campaign, a violation of state law. It also appears that
those who agreed to sign their names to the letters were not informed
about how their names would be used.^["Garza campaign letter
stirs furor, appears to have violated state law," *San Jose Sun*, August
16, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1.]

Garza campaign tries to racialize the Hayes administration, suggesting
that under her administration East Side was often overlooked. Garza
supporters contend that Hayes---who lives in "fashionable" Rose
Garden---gets "sweaty palms" when she has to host functions in East
Side.^["The Politics of Growth in San Jose," *California Journal*,
October 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

In 1977, Rosalynn Carter made an appearance in San Jose for a Hayes
fundraiser.^["The Politics of Growth in San Jose," *California Journal*,
October 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

Jerry Estruth, a 35 year old stockbroker, is trying to unseat long-time
council member Joe Colla. Colla owns a drugstore in downtown San Jose,
is known for being a maverick.^["The Politics of Growth in San Jose,"
*California Journal*, October 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

Susie Wilson faced off against Ivan Zubow, a "well-to-do Morgan Hill
developer." Zubow put $76,000 if his own money into his campaign.^["The
Politics of Growth in San Jose," *California Journal*, October 1978,
Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers. That's the same buying power as
$272,419.20 in 2015 dollars.]

Joe Colla, on the Tedesco firing: "He was anti-growth, and this is now a
pro-growth city."^["The Politics of Growth in San Jose," *California
Journal*, October 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

In the June primary, Garza came within 18,000 votes of unseating Hayes.
He also carried several suburban white, middle-class neighborhoods
considered safe by Hayes, according to the SF Chronicle.^["A Tough Race
for Mayor of Sprawling San Jose," *San Francisco Chronicle*, October 14,
1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.] Garza swept up votes from East
Side, where he's from.

The *SF Chronicle* calls the pro- and slow-growth campaign "The
Issue."^["A Tough Race for Mayor of Sprawling San Jose," *San Francisco
Chronicle*, October 14, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

Hayes argues for slower growth, saying the city should focus on serving
the needs of those in the city first before allowing new neighborhoods
to be created. Garza disagrees, arguing that growth means more jobs and
affordable housing. The average house in San Jose (a four bedroom tract
unit) sells for \$75,000.^["A Tough Race for Mayor of Sprawling San
Jose," *San Francisco Chronicle*, October 14, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1,
Hayes Papers.]

Hayes is critical of Garza's "back room" ouster of Tedesco, a
limited-growth advocate voted out in a 4-to-3 council vote.^["A Tough
Race for Mayor of Sprawling San Jose," *San Francisco Chronicle*,
October 14, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

More than half of Garza's \$18,377 monetary contributions to his
campaign came from development and construction interests.^["Finding
money the key play in the campaign game," *San Jose Mercury*, October 8,
1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

Hayes also received \$18,700 from monetary contributions, with near
equal amounts coming from business and development.^["Finding
money the key play in the campaign game," *San Jose Mercury*, October 8,
1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

Jerry Estruth's campaign received \$4,870 from business interests. More
than half of Joe Colla's campaign's \$8,678 came from development
interests.^["Finding money the key play in the campaign game," *San
Jose Mercury*, October 8, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

Zubow and Wilson both received major support from developers: \$8,350
for Zubow, \$9,675 for Wilson.^["Finding money the key play in the
campaign game," *San Jose Mercury*, October 8, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1,
Hayes Papers.]

The orchestration of Tedesco's firing was created by the "Fearsome
Four" (Al Garza; David Runyon, a real estate man on the council for a
year and a half; Joe Colla; and Larry Pegram, the council's only
Republican) up against the rest of the council (Janet Hayes; Susanne
Wilson; Jim Self)^["Hayes stops jogging, starts running in re-election
bid," *San Jose Mercury*, October 12, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes
Papers; "The Politics of Growth in San Jose," *California
Journal*, October 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

In December 1976 Hayes and three others on the council defeated a
proposal by Garza to study development program for Coyote Valley. In
December 1977 she scuttled a \$150,000 consultant study of Coyote backed
by Garza and Colla. Garza claims the studies were for council
information only.^["Hayes stops jogging, starts running in re-election
bid," *San Jose Mercury*, October 12, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes
Papers.]

San Jose had around nine million dollars worth of industrial permits
issued in 1975, eighteen million in 1976, fifty-six million in 1977, and
a possible eight million in 1978.^["Hayes stops jogging, starts running
in re-election bid," *San Jose Mercury*, October 12, 1978, Folder 13,
Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

**Need to look up the 1976 general plan -- it's considered a bridle on
growth**

The Fearsome Four also pushed through a roads program along with the
ouster of Tedesco.^["Garza complains foe using 'fear tactics, outright
lies'," *San Jose Mercury*, October 12, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes
Papers.]

The Fearsome Foursome abolished a city policy tying new growth to adequate
streets; adopted a \$28 million road program favoring new development
rather than existing needs; fired city manager Tedesco; approved a new
tax on development days before Prop 13 made it illegal.^["It's a single
issue race," *San Jose Sun*, October 24, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes
papers.]

The Fearsome Foursome suggests the firing of Tedesco had to do with his
unwillingness to carry out the will of the majority.^["Challenger Al
Garza," *San Jose Mercury*, October 31, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes
papers.]

Garza: "The four of us [Fearsome Foursome] came together in a sense
because we were against what Mrs. Hayes and Mr. Tedesco stood for and
that is giving money to the bureaucracy and cutting it out of programs.
The issue, for example, has never been parks or roads. It was salary and
roads."^["Challenger Al Garza," *San Jose Mercury*, October 31, 1978,
Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes papers.]

Hayes says San Jose has "one of the best business climates in the state
or nation," noting that industrial permits rose from \$9 million in 1974
to \$56 million by 1977.^["Incumbent Janet Gray Hayes," *San Jose
Mercury*, October 31, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes papers.]

Hayes sees herself as a post-Watergate candidate trying to instill trust
in government. Toward that end, Hayes initiated monthly open office
hours and a Mayor's Hotline.^["Incumbent Janet Gray Hayes," *San Jose
Mercury*, October 31, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes papers.]

Although other issues arose during the campaign (primarily
law-and-order), growth has remained center: the controversial roads
package, the ouster of Ted Tedesco.^["San Jose's future growth main
issue in campaign," *San Jose Mercury*, November 3, 1978.]

- It feels like Garza tried to make this a bigger campaign issue;
  perhaps worried that the growth record would come back to bite him?

The 1975 General Plan is a sticking point: largely seen as limiting
growth; Hayes supported it, Garza was opposed but did not vote on the
plan. Garza says his opposition was due to the plan's call for high
density development to protect open space, which he contends would do
nothing to actually save open space.^["San Jose's future growth main
issue in campaign," *San Jose Mercury*, November 3, 1978.]

Out of all political donors that served as "development interests,"
sixty percent supported Garza to Hayes' forty percent.^["San Jose's
future growth main issue in campaign," *San Jose Mercury*, November 3,
1978.]

Hayes swept past Garza in the election, claiming over 70% of the vote.
Jerry Estruth, challenging for Joe Colla's seat, took more than 60% of
the vote.^["Hayes sweeps past Garza to re-election," *San Jose Mercury*,
November 8, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes papers.]

The \$14,000 pledge to Garza from the Builders and Contractors Committee
was the largest gift reported in the campaign. Both candidate spent
nearly \$200,000, the most expensive ever waged in San Jose.^["Hayes
sweeps past Garza to re-election," *San Jose Mercury*, November 8, 1978,
Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes papers.]

Susanne Wilson won her bid for the Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors, replacing a retiring Sig Sanchez.^["The voters speak," *San
Jose Mercury*, November 8, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes papers.]

Hayes: "The message I get again is that people in San Jose want limited
growth. They don't want another Los Angeles. It's a clear
mandate."^["Sweet Triumph for San Jose's Mayor," *San Francisco
Chronicle*, November 9, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes papers.]

David Runyon, part of the Fearsome Foursome, was forced to resign
following a public drinking scandal. He was replaced by Tom McEnery, a
limited growth advocate.^["Sweet Triumph for San Jose's Mayor," *San
Francisco Chronicle*, November 9, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes papers.]



## Al Garza

Al Garza is a native of East San Jose.^["Garza berates mayor in bid to
unseat her," *San Jose Mercury*, March 6, 1978 Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes
Papers.]

Garza has a history as a school teacher and school
administrator.^["Garza berates mayor in bid to unseat her," *San Jose
Mercury*, March 6, 1978 Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

Garza faced off against Hayes in 1970 and lost;
he was appointed to city council in 1971 to fill a vacant seat created
by the death of vice mayor Kurt Gross. He ran for the seat in 1973 and
again in 1976.^["Garza berates mayor in bid to unseat her," *San Jose
Mercury*, March 6, 1978 Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

Garza: "Her idea of sound fiscal planning is to blindly cut city
services (through the budget) when it's politically expedient, without
any forethought as to how costly later on such measures will be to the
already overtaxed property owners."^["Garza berates mayor in bid to
unseat her," *San Jose Mercury*, March 6, 1978 Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes
Papers.]

Garza a "longtime critic" of the city's "failure" to provide East Side
with "services and amenities."^["Garza berates mayor in bid to unseat
her," *San Jose Mercury*, March 6, 1978 Folder 13, Box 1, Hayes Papers.]

## Janet Hayes

Hayes cited her experience in "attracting more industrial business than
any other city in the nation except Los Angeles while maintaining
balanced urban growth" (direct quote) during her first term as
mayor.^["Mayor Hayes makes it official---running again," *San Jose
News*, March 9, 1978.]

Hayes doesn't appear to have higher political aspirations, saying she
has "roots [that] go very deep in San Jose" and that moving would be
"very difficult."^["Mayor Hayes makes it official---running again," *San
Jose News*, March 9, 1978.]

Says Garza is "more pro-development," citing his support of opening
Coyote Valley to residential development. Hayes says that she is "much
more restrained on growth than he is, but I'm not a no-growth
advocate."^["Mayor Hayes makes it official---running again," *San Jose
News*, March 9, 1978.]

She notes some of the problems in San Jose, such as the lack of
"plentiful and reasonably priced housing" and the need "to complete the
101 Bypass, the West Valley Corridor and the Guadalupe
Expressway."^["Mayor Hayes makes it official---running again," *San
Jose News*, March 9, 1978.]

Hayes also hired 100 new police officers, cut city property tax rate,
created 20,000 new jobs in private industry, and noted that San Jose was
declared the second-most livable city in the West.^["Mayor Hayes makes
it official---running again," *San Jose News*, March 9, 1978.]

Hayes got her political start through her children, starting out in PTA
meetings then becoming PTA president, then president of the League of
Women Voters, and then City Council.^["Difference is 'clear,' says mayor
of rival," *San Jose Mercury News*, May 12, 1978, Folder 13, Box 1,
Hayes Papers.]

## Builders supporting Garza, Colla

The Builders and Contractors Committee, chaired by Gary Brooks, pledged
$14,000 to Garza's campaign to unseat Hayes. They also planned to give
incumbent Joe Colla $10,000 to stand up against the challenger Jerry
Estruth.[^15]

The Builders and Contractors Committee pledged an additional $10,000 to
defeat a city redistricting plan, and another $1,000 to pass a senior
citizen housing referendum.[^16]

The pledges are the largest contributions (to date) in any local city,
county or state race "so far."[^17]

Bill Williams (of Sea Homes, a member of the committee): "I can only
surmise that the majority of our members felt that those two people
(Garza and Colla) are better for our industry."[^18]

The committee is, according to Bill Williams, made up of "local
builders, contractors, mortgage bankers, people in associated industries
--- a pretty broad spectrum of people associated with the development
industry."[^19]

The Builders and Contractors Committee has 25--30 members.[^20]
