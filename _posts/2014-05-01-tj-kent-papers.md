Scope and Content
-----------------

The T.J. "Jack" Kent papers selectively cover a career in urban and regional planning that lasted over 50 years. The collection includes correspondence (primarily professional rather than personal), research notes, drafts of essays and talks, published books and articles, UC Berkeley course notes, and early records from Kent's work in the UC Berkeley department of City and Regional Planning (DCRP). The collection also contains newsletters, reports, and memoranda of the various government and civic planning organizations of which Kent was a member, including the Berkeley City Council, People for Open Space, the San Francisco Department of City Planning, and Telesis. Also includes a small amount of material on the University loyalty oath.
