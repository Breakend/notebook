Nash writes about the centrality of the federal government in shaping the West
in the twentieth century. He notes the government "may not have been the only
influence on the shaping of the West in the twentieth century, but it must be
considered the dominant force." (x)

Nash's methodology borrows from Nicolae Kondratieff, a Russian economist in the
1920s, who proposed three long waves in economic activity. The first wave
occurred between 1787 and 1845 and emerged from steam engines and new sources of
power. The second wave came between 1845 and 1890 when steamships and Bessemer
furnaces provided new technologies of power. The third phase occurred between
1890 and 1947 as electric light, alternating currents, and automobiles were the
technologies that drove new industries. Nash extrapolates and offers a fourth
wave beginning sometime in the late 1960s: the "further development of the
transistor" (first invented in 1947) and "especially its adaptation in the
computer chip (1971)." (xi)

Nash also borrows from Joseph Schumpeter, who updates Kondratieff in the 1930s
my emphasizing the role of technology and that the beginning of each wave started
with technological innovations. The Kondratieff-Schumpeter cycles explain cycles
of growth in the western United States, according to Nash. But these waves of
technology were not the only factors shaping the West; global monetary
conditions also shaped entrepreneurial activity in the West.
