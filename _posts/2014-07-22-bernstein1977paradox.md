## Notes

p. 1: Santa Clara County is "one of the fastest growing regions in the United 
States. Population, now 1,200,000, has nearly doubled since 1960. Economic 
development as well as population growth has been concentrated in the 
northwest part of the county, extending from Palo Alto in the north, to San 
Jose, the county seat and population center. In 1956, San Jose covered 22 
square miles. Today it spreads over 140 square miles of surrounding land."

p. 3: "The rapid expansion of industrial parks and electronics plants has 
accelerated the process of urban sprawl, covering the old orchards with 
low-density factories and tracts. Because industry has chosen to concentrate 
in the northwest county, and cities provided more land for industry than 
housing, many employees, particularly lower income workers, are unable to 
find housing near their jobs."

p. 3: The result of the housing shortage has caused "increased commuting and 
heavy traffic flows snarl local highways and roads. Increased automobile use 
has intensified local pollution problems."

p. 3: Notes that northern cities have a robust industrial tax base, whereas 
southern cities lack the tax base and additionally provide most of the 
services for commuting workers.

p. 3: Identifying the main problems: pollution, housing, taxes, job security, 
local over-dependence on military spending. The origin of these problems 
according to the pamphlet is the high technology industries.

p. 4: High technology's location in Santa Clara County is a result of "a 
naturally pleasant climate, [and] it offered a combination of land, labor, 
technological resources, financing, and access to markets."

p. 4-5: Notes the historical origins of Stanford's interest in electronics, 
dating to 1909 and the formation of the Federal Telegraph Company by Cyrus 
Elwell. In the 1930s, Frederick Terman began encouraging his students to 
create their own companies rather than migrate to the east coast. Terman's 
students included John Kaar (Kaar Industries - two way radios), Bill Hewlett 
and David Packard, and Russell and Sigurd Varian. 

p. 6: Cites the central role played by Terman in creating a place where 
electronics research could flourish. Calls it his "conscious vision" for the 
Peninsula and quotes him: "We have been pioneers in creating a new type of 
community, one that I have caleld a 'community of technical scholars.' Such a 
community is composed of industries using highly sophisticated technologies, 
together with a strong university that is sensitive to the creative activities 
of the surrounding industry. This pattern appears to be the wave of the 
future."

p. 7: The establishment of the Industrial Park attracted a range of 
industries, including Sylvania, Philco, GE, and Lockheed. Quoting Lockheed 
official Douglas Moffat: "We moved to get better access to the right sort of 
manpower so that we could establish a working environment with the right 
intellectual atmosphere."

Reasons for growth:

- "The pleasant climate of Santa Clara County helped create the suburban lifestyle which many young scientists found addictive. The professionals, who provided the brainpower essential for the development of high technology industry, found it hard to leave the area." (6)
- "The climate, SRI, and the engineering school might have propelled Santa Clara County into the space age without further planning, but the conscious vision of Frederick Terman established the Peninsula as America's leading center of high technology industry." (6)
- "In 1951, the university leased a section of its vast lands to Varian Associates, and the following year it leased to Hewlett-Packard as well. In 1954, the university board of trustees announced a formal policy, the development of an industrial park for high technology industry on Stanford lands." (7)
- "Continued military spending and the beginning of the space race fueled growth of new Stanford spin-offs." (7)

Major firms were attracted to the area in the 1950s, including Sylvania (GT&E), Lockheed, Philco, and GE. Lockheed official Douglas Moffat noted: "We moved to get better access to the right sort of manpower so that we could establish a working environment with the right intellectual atmosphere." (7)

The pamphlet also notes that there was "no tradition of electronic workers' organization" in the area and, thus, companies didn't have to deal with labor unions. (10)

"The geography of Santa Clara County, federal contracts, venture capital, and the concentration of technological resources put together by Stanford University have built an industrial complex characterized by what Fortune's Gene Bylinsky has called 'an innovative ferment on a scale without precedent in industrial society.' Only now are the residents of the county recognizing that the glamorous electronics industry has brought some problems, too." (14)

"Instead of liberating humanity from meaningless labor, technology has increased specialization, centralization, and unemployment." (15)

Pamphlet notes that around 50,000 people commute from other areas in the county (39)

"Next to Livermore, Santa Clara County has the worst level of air pollution in the entire Bay Area." (39)

"Housing, transportation, environment. Too often these problems seem separate and distinct. In fact, however, they origins of these problems are inextricably linked to the growth and development of local high technology industries. The private decisions made by the electronics industry have affected the housing problem, shaped the commuting pattern of the county, and contributed to environmental degradation." (39)

Notes a crisis in housing: "The average wage earner cannot afford the lowest priced new single family home even in South County, not to mention a house in the higher priced Palo Alto area. Many families spend too much of their income on housing. Many of the available units are in need of heavy repairs and are overcrowded. Most housing is located too far from centers of employment. And finally, many people still face blatant and illegal discrimination in their search for a place to live." (40)

Argues that industrial growth "was and is planned with no concern for where the majority of employees would be able to live." (40)

Cites Robert Mang, head of the Santa Clara County Housing Task Force:

> Palo Alto showed the rest of the county in the late 1950's that it was more beneficial to have a clean industry base which yields a net gain in revenues than to have a lot of single family homes which, below a certain assessed valuation, use more services than they yield in taxes. So Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, Cupertino, and San Jose picked up on this and where many of them used to be the bedroom communities that served Palo Alto's jobs, they've now become the competitors for industry and also not balanced their industrial expansion with sufficient housing." (40) 

Cities rezoned residential areas for industrial use; between 1965 and 1975 the number of housing units that could be accommodated by zoning plans fell from 978,000 to 561,000. Fewer multi-dwelling units were being built as well. Low vacancy rates also became evidence of the worsening housing issue. In 1971 the county had a rate of 13.1%, but in 1976 the figure dropped to 3.1%. In Palo Alto alone, the vacancy rate became 0.4%. (40-41)

Pamphlet finds that ninety percent of local residents arrive to work by car, and the Transportation Agency estimates that 35% to 40% of all county travel is commuting to work. On average, the commute length was fifteen miles per day. (47)

"The San Jose to Mountain View area is one of the prime examples of the land use phenomenon labeled 'urban sprawl.' Low density economic development has blotted out the natural beauty of the land. Industrial parks, freeways and housing tracts have covered the once fertile land with asphalt and concrete. Population growth and industrial development have caused the visible deterioration of our land, water, air and other natural and human resources." (49)

"Among the most visible and harmful of these environmental problems is the deteriorating quality of the air in Santa Clara County. Except Livermore, the county has the worst air pollution problems in the entire Bay Area, even worse than the heavily industrialized East Bay." (49)

Part of the problem is due to wind patterns that blow in pollutants from other areas of the Bay and become trapped in the valley. But local sources, particularly automobiles, contribute the most. "Every day, cars in this area release 850 tons of the poisonous gas carbon monoxide into the air, as well as 240 tons of organic gases, an ingredient of smog. Both of these amounts are the highest recorded in the Bay Area." (P. 49) The worst of the pollution is around San Jose and extends north to Sunnyvale, the "heart of the commute route." In other words, "the location of industry which forces daily commuting is directly responsible for the declining air quality." (49)

The industries themselves produce environmental threats:

- "These firms, particularly semiconductor manufacturers, use large quantities of toxic and corrosive chemicals as part of their production process. These chemicals must be neutralized before being discharged by sewage treatment plants into the Bay or being reclaimed for irrigation and other outdoor uses." (50)
-	"Inside the plant, workers are daily exposed to an array of dangerous organic solvents. These chemicals cause nausea and dizziness, as well as more severe liver and kidney problems, and possibly cancer." (50)
-	"The final area of environmental impact of high technology firms is their heavy use of water even in times of drought. Local industry uses from one quarter to one third of the water supplied to the cities in which they are located. Most municipalities, with the exception of Palo Alto, actually encourage heavy water consumption by charging less the more you use. Homeowners are thereby charged higher rates than industrial users, who use more. For example, Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation has been known to use as much as 20% of the water supplied to Mountain View in a single month. In Sunnyvale, there are more than 60 corporations each using more than 50,000 gallons of water a day." (50)
