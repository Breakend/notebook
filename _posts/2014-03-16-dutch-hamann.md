Anthony P. "Dutch" Hamann was appointed city manager in 1950 by the city
council. Hamann assumed the position at forty years old, having spent his life
as a businessman, teacher, and district manager for Chevrolet. He was a graduate
of Santa Clara University and had good connections and strong ideas for the city.

Hamann is credited for San Jose's expansive growth during his time in office,
although as people questioned the costs associated with urban growth his legacy
was questioned. His team was nicknamed "Dutch's Panzer Division," but Hamann has
a metropolitan vision that San Jose wanted. George Starbird remembered:

> [Hamann] said, if you wanted to grow and be able to pay the bill, you had to
> annex surrounding areas to the City. To do that, you couldn't sit on your
> hands. Pretty soon you would become like Bakersfield and St. Louis, an enclave
> circled by other small incorporated cities or special service districts that
> would tie you up forever. If you got bottled up, your tax rate would put you
> out of the running for new industries; they would go to Sunnyvale or Santa
> Clara, your assessed valuation would remain frozen. It was as bad as being
> hemmed in by geographical barriers, samples of which were many in all size
> cities. It was really just that simple.^[Quoted in Matthews, 96.]

Under Hamann's tenure, the San Jose Chamber of Commerce spent around $1 million
to attract new industry. By 1970, the city had grown from 95,280 in 1950 to
445,779, and 16.98 square miles to 136.7 square miles thanks to
annexations.^[Matthews, 97.]
