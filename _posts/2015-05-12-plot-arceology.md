Date range limited by Ben to 1930, not sure how to include the Silent Era. But the Open Subtitles set stretches to 1890.

One choice to make is what the individual documents being represented are.

Something here about plot structures and showing these trends.

Recent experiments in plot structure:

-	Andrew Piper, [conversion novels](http://txtlab.org/?p=459)
-	Andrew Piper, "[Novel Devotions](http://piperlab.mcgill.ca/pdfs/Piper_NovelConversions_Preprint.pdf)"
-	Matt Jockers, [Syuzhet](https://github.com/mjockers/syuzhet)

Sees plot structure applied to novels an insane approach -- they're
complicated, and the primary domain of DH in English. Makes Ben wonder why
there's a hope we can find useful archetype structures.

The best vocabulary for talking about structures over time is musicologists.
Novels may not map onto structures very well. The efforts to find common,
underlying plot structures in novels will not likely be fruitful.

Television does allow for forms that are rigidly bound.

Bureaucratic processes are more easily understood.

Ben is critical of the overuse of topic modeling, but can be appropriate.
Topics as a way of reducing down the dimensional space these things are
traveling through.

Mark: How comfortable are you in using the script as a proxy for the show?

Changes over time in formulaicity of documents

dynamic topic modeling -- tries to understand changes in the meaning of words over time.

# Other Notes

I have a project in mind listening to all of this and seeing what Ben is working on. I want to get the scripts for western film....
