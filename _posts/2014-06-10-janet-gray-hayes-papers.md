Notes
-----

**Looking at material on 2014-05-17**:

* Box 1, Folder 20
  * "A Survey of Voter Attitudes in the City of San Jose," Diridon Research
  Corporation, 1974
    * pp 164 total
    * Surveying voter attitudes; photographed relevant passages on
    environment, growth, and open space.
* Box 1, Folder 13
  * Clippings, Mayoral Reelection Campaign 1978
    * "Mrs. Hayes opens mayor campaign"
      * She's citing her "balanced urban growth" as a key feature in her bid
      for reelection. This is significant.
      * Image caption in the SJMN of June 1978 notes that Hayes ran "on a
      limited growth platform. The election of a Hayes ally to the city
      council gives the limited growth forces a majority."
      * Photographed some key articles from here. This campaign is good -- a
      good example of how growth became an explosive political issue. The
      entire campaign between Garza and Hayes surrounded issues of growth.
