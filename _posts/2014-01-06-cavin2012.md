# Introduction

"the mythology of Silicon Valley concealed persistent divisions of race and class while also erasing history, celebrating certain residents -- especially entrepreneurs and Asian engineers who bolstered the meritocratic myth of the American Dream -- while obscuring others." (2)

"Until the 1960s, Mexican American colonias -- semi-rural communities linked to the agricultural economy -- stood on the outskirts of San Jose, and Japanese American farming communities were scattered throughout the Valley." (2)

Cavin "explores the spatial politics of citizenship over the course of the twentieth century, focusing on the second half of the century, a time of rapid metropolitan growth. It tells the stories of local activists, politicians, business owners, and ordinary residents who shaped the political and economic structure of the metropolis." (3)

The "multiracial context of the metropolis shaped the conception, emergence, and implementation of racial zoning, housing covenants, and the home mortgage financing programs of the federal government. Movements for property rights, fair housing, and affordable housing took form in the Valley's multiracial landscapes, as Latinos, Asian Americans, and African Americans sometimes worked together, sometimes fought each other, and often adopted each other's political strategies." (6)

"For them [Japanese and Mexican Americans], the national border overlapped with the racial borders that fragmented the postwar metropolis. Since the federal state delegates power to local jurisdictions, creating boundaries in metropolitan space, the suburbs, too, were 'legal borderlands,' locations where laws articulate who is inside and outside the nation." (16)

Popular accounts of "suburbanization is the story of white families settling unpopulated green space. What columnist David Brooks calls the 'great dispersal' of suburbanization is an epilogue in the narrative of Westward movement of white Americans, with the suburbanite in the role of pioneer and exurbia as an extension of 'virgin land' and unspoiled frontier wilderness. In a 1958 article that portrayed Santa Clara County as the epitome of sprawl, William H. Whyte summed up suburbanization as 'countryside . . . being bulldozed under' -- a phrase that suggests a natural landscape void of inhabitants.30 Suburban history, in turn, has echoed, in the words of Andrew Needham and Allen Dieterich-Ward, this “Turnerian framework” in which 'the bulldozer marks the beginning of historical time on the crabgrass frontier.' In this view, suburbanization is a story of moving out in which whites are the original suburbanites."(22)

"Silicon Valley, however, became a wellspring of a new political culture -- racially moderate, pro-business, and culturally liberal -- that was so reliably Democratic that political observers John Judis and Ruy Teixeira saw the future of the Democratic Party in places like Silicon Valley."^[An interesting contrast from other places in California like Orange County, which is seen as the wellspring of conservatism. See McGirr.] (35)

"In the Silicon Valley, diverse residents -- Japanese American homeowners, white residential developers, Mexican American schoolparents -- shared the civic language of the market, with its terminologies of choice, opportunity, and property, but they mobilized it for diverse political purposes, from housing desegregation to environmental justice." (37)

# Chapter 3

"At the center of the Valley's suburban growth was a transformation in the political construction of property markets, beginning in the 1930s with temporary programs aimed to ease the Depression's mortgage crisis, and continuing after the war with permanent programs that facilitated mortgage lending and established mortgage markets. Housing policies, in turn, combined with other postwar growth policies -- particularly in transportation and federal technology investment -- to create a new geography in the South Bay." (167)

Federal policies "redefined urban space in terms of whiteness and nonwhiteness," particularly by "redefin[ing] nonwhiteness as merely an actuarial risk." (167) The presence of minorities in Santa Clara County did not threaten white society, but rather posed a danger to property values.

# Chapter 4

"In the postwar era, the city [San Jose] embarked on a meteoric rise. With a population of 68,457 in 1940, San José was a tenth the size of San Francisco. But by century’s end, with nearly one million residents, San José was the largest city in Northern California, more than twice the size of Oakland, and one of the largest cities in the nation.9 San José expanded city limits to annex much of the surrounding area, growing in area from 17 square miles in 1950 to 137 square miles in 1969.10 As it expanded, it encompassed much of the new suburban development." (206)

"Suburban development changed the agricultural region. HOLC surveyors had commented on the agrarian character of San José, where civilization and nature intertwined, economically and geographically. 'The city,' reported T. H. Bowden, 'might literally be said to have been carved from a forest of fruit trees, as most of the residential sections were orchards prioacr to being subdivided, and many of the original
11 trees still ornament the gardens of the invading residences.'"^[Bowden, *Report of a Survey in San Jose, California*, 2.]

# Method

Cavin uses race and racial formation as the key category for analysis.

Cavin also deploys space as a central analytic framework, "exploring the ways in which space shaped residents' social and political identities. . . . The Valley produced a range of spatial politics, from Japanese American's efforts to resettle their neighborhoods peacefully after wartime internment to Mexican Americans' struggles for school desegregation." (8)

# "White Flight"

Cavin challenges the idea of "white flight" as an explanatory tool, arguing that is "weak" by "emphasizing decision to flee racial transition in urban neighborhoods rather than the political economy of metropolitan development, which drew white residents to suburban areas regardless of urban racial patterns." (23) The idea of flight also "defines suburbanization as the experiences of white (usually affluent) people" that ignores the presence of racial minorities who were part of or took part in suburban processes. (32)
