In conversation with Leslie Berlin and Margaret O'Mara on 2015-02-17 (at
Tressider Blue Bottle):

- Introduced the idea of the Silicon Valley Database for tracking
  historical high-tech companies in the Bay Area.
- Wanting to 1) understand better the geographic 'center' of the Valley
  over time; 2) test the prevailing story of Stanford's ripple effect
  (Industrial Park led to outward establishments vs. a possible story
  about simultaneous establishments).

Questions:

- What else can we track?
    - Property owners / renters of these business spaces? Who is involved
    in development / real estate here? How could we track that down?
    - The number of employees / size of the company.
- LB: [Dotcom Archive](http://dotcomarchive.org/) site, talk to David
  Kirsch -- he might have some similar information he'd be willing to
  share.
    - LB willing to make introductions; send her an email.

Potential database fields:

- Address/location
- Date
- Stories
- Photos
- How to ensure verifiable info? Letterhead?
- Company size
- Employee size
- Type of company? (shift from manufacturing to services) -- let's us track the
  Kodak vs. Instagram shift (these new start-up don't produce jobs like
  the old manufacturing facilities did. Lots of jobs early on created by
  tech; not the case now.)
- How can we incorporate more of the real estate into this? Who are the
  developers? Property owners? Renters?
- How to reach these people?
    - Historical societies
    - History Harvest?
    - Retirement communities

## Random

- Learned that Nikita Khurschev was in San Jose in the 1950s, touring the IBM
  plant. [Story from MO][]. I've archived this article in Evernote.
    - Remember, also, that Charles De Gaulle visited Palo Alto in the
    1960s.[^1]
    - See also this [American Experience documentary](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/roadshow/).
