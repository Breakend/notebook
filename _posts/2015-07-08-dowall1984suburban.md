## Chapter 1

p. 1:

> Land use planners across America are facing hard choices. Should they exert strict control over development, as environmentalists and neighborhood groups demand? Or should they aim for more housing at affordable prices, as employers, housing advocates, and tenants urge? Since the early 1970s, the arguments of well-organized environmentalists and homeowner associations have prevailed in many of the nation's communities.

p. 1: 

> The virtues of this policy have been evident. The qualtiy of the environment *has* improved, and people appreciate it. But now the costs of this policy are also becoming clear: wherever stringent land-use controls have come up against burgeoning demand for housing, land and home prices have skyrocketed.

p. 2: Cites previous studies (including Douglas and Kaiser Commissions) examining the inflationary effects of local land use and zoning controls.

p. 2: 

> Will the latest studies be met by as much indifference as the former ones? I think not, because it is no longer the poor who are hurt by overly restrictive and exclusionary land use controls, but the majority of first-time home buyers. There is a growing constituency for relaxed land use controls and more affordable housing.

p. 2: Proposing four major goals for the book:

1. "I believe that the highly restrictive controls on growth *do* harm communities, businesses, and individual citizens." (2)
2. "Second, I wish to demonstrate the reasons for this conviction, using new data from a region where the inflationary effects of land use regulations have been especially severe: the San Francisco Bay Area." (2)
3. "I want to give practical help to local land use planners and communities struggling to preserve environmental quality while also providing reasonably priced homes." (2)
4. "I want to speak out for new land use policies at the regional and national level, for the problem is one all of America must reckon with." (2)

p. 3:

> For all its simplicity and straightforwardness, though, zoning had real flaws. It was too insensitive and crude a method of regulating development. It reinforced patterns of economic and racial segregation. It set aside land for uses no one honestly expected to occur. It did not control the timing of development and it prevented multiple uses of land, even if those uses were compatible. Above all, zoning was indifferent to environmental issues, with unhappy results that were all too plain.

p. 3:

> Reacting to citizen pressure in the late 1960s, planners began seeking new ways to regulate development and suburban growth. The most important of these was the requirement, imposed by the National Environmental Protection Act, that environmental impact statements be prepared for "major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment." The California Supreme Court (in Friends of Mammoth vs. Mono County, 1972) expanded the requirement to include all large development projects, private as well as public. To the EIRs demanded by the federal government, the states and local communities added their own layers of rules and regulations.

p. 4: "According to a recent survey of land use planning activity, over 50 percent of communities in the San Francisco Bay Area are actively limiting population growth."^[Dowall cites State of California Office of Planning and Research, *Local Government Planning Survey: 1975* (Sacramento, 1976).]

p. 4: "The whole process of land development has been altered radically by the proliferation of environmental regulations. And while all types of projects have been affected, residential development has been hardest hit. Residential construction is not only the most prevalent form of community development, but also tends to be the most closely regulated."

p. 4:

> It would be irresponsible and inaccurate to say that these changes in local land use control are entirely pernicious. On the contrary, land use controls sensitive to the environment are an advance over the blunt instrument of zoning, and on the whole they have fulfilled their original intent. But it is the very success of these new methods that makes it so difficult to respond to concerns with overregulation and to inflationary land and housing prices.

p. 6: The surge in housing prices led homebuyers to be excluded from the market. "This problem has not gone unnoticed by employers. In areas with relatively high home prices, recruitment of employees has become increasingly difficult. Concern is running particularly high in the San Francisco Bay Area, which has the highest median housing prices in the nation."

pp. 6-7: "In Santa Clara County, the home of Silicon Valley, the booming electronics industry is having trouble attracting employees. The Santa Clara County Manufacturing Group has been studying the land use and housing policies of the fifteen cities in the county, as well as surveying its members to determine their plans for expansion. The group's aim is to reshape local land use and development policies so that industry can be assured of an adequate supply of land and housing to meet future expansion needs."

p. 10: "There will be no quiet land use revolution in the 1980s. Instead, loud skirmishes will be in community after community, all across the country. And while corporations may enter the fray, they will face homeowners, ratepayers, and environmentalists fiercely defending their turf."

## Chapter 2

p. 14: "Nowhere else in the nation do communities so aggressively restrict development."

p. 14: Suggests the SF Bay Area is the best place to study these regulations given the "high level of restruction on the region's land markets, together with the pressures of continuing population growth"

p. 15: Since World War II the nine counties of the Bay Area all experienced the "suburban land squeeze": extensive land development, use of growth management tools, restricted land use, environmental regulations, and "'go-slow' development posture exacerbated by the passage of Propositions 4 and 13."

p. 15: An inventory of land compiled by ABAG in 1975 found that 350,000 of the region's 4.5 million acres were vacant and developable.^[Dowall cites Association of Bay Area Governments, *Summary Report, Provisional Series 3 Projections* (Berkeley, 2 March 1977).]

p. 15: Dowall suggests the Bay Area's land squeeze results less from vacant land that simply cannot be developed due to rugged topography or sensitive environmental character, but rather results from "the restrictive land use and development regulations imposed by the region's more than one hundred local governments."

p. 15--16: Thanks to returning World War II veterans taking advantage of VA housing funding and developers who purchased low-cost land on the urban fringe, populations soared in the Bay Area.

p. 17: Land development in the 1950s followed transportation corridors.

p. 23: See footnote 3, Lane monographs on the concerns about urban growth.^[Dowall citing Kingsley Davis and Eleanor Langolis, *Future Demographic Growth of the San Francisco Bay Area* (Berkeley: Institute of Governmental Studies, 1963).]

p. 24: Concerns that local land controls would halt development led to ideas about regional government in order to make government more responsive and not behold to hundreds of individual decisions by local governments. State Assemblyman John Knox introduced a bill in the 1960s to establish a regional government, but a regional government never emerged. 

p. 32: The "most intensive discussion of the regional problems engendered by local actions" has taken place in Santa Clara County. Concerned about the rapid growth of high tech industry, the county created a task force to study the problem of limited housing. Communities in the north end of the county aggressively sought new industries, but simultaneously limited the construction of new housing. Home prices soared. The county recommended more housing in its report *Living Without Our Limits*^[Santa Clara County Industry and Housing Management Task Force, *Living Within Our Limits* (San Jose: County, San Jose Environmental Management AGency, November 1979).] Interestingly, the advocates of more housing are not pro-housing advocates but the private sector. The Santa Clara County Manufacturing Group especially has monitored housing and called for more residential construction. 

## General Notes

The remainder of the book focuses on six case studies in the Bay Area: Santa Rosa (Sonoma County), Napa (Napa County), Concord (Contra Costa County), Novato (Marin County), San Rafael (Marin County), and Fremont (Alameda County).
