            * p.1: "the program of land exploitation pursued by the school
            during the past ten years has succeeded in primarily in eliminating
            much of the natural beauty and attraction that have, in the past,
            contributed so much toward making Stanford the top school in the
            west."

            referendum
        * Letter from Margaret Stebbins to David Packard, March 11 1960
            * "It is obvious, from the traffic jams n our country roads from
            already existing industrial plants, that Stanford has given no
            consideration to this very critical and serious problem. . . .
            Aesthetically and practically, too, non-industrial development (such
            as SRI and others of its type) in the foothills seems far more
            desirable than industrial plants. However well landscaped they may
            be they continue to be ugly complexes of huge parking areas and
            great barns of buildings."

        * Letter from Alf Brandin to Planning Commission, Apr 14 1960
            * Brandin notes that they will hold industrial development to
            "rigid standards" to "preserve the rolling terrain and its open
            feeling. For example, as a minimum we will require sites of not less
            than five acres, front yard setbacks of not less than one hundred
            feet, and building coverage of not more than twenty per cent."

        * news clipping, "P.A. Park Urged In Foothills" SJ Merc 4/24/62
            * a group calling themselves United Palo Altans is pushing for the
            foothills to remain undeveloped and turned into a state or national
            park; also urging that the foothills be reclassed from light
            industry to R-1 residential zoning.

What is the Citizen's Committee for Regional Planning?

   * seems to be a reaction to Stanford plans to develop the foothills
   * what are their initial concerns? members? reason for existence?

**Looking at material on 2014-01-23:**

* Box 18
    * Folder 27 "Land and Building Development Advisory Committee"
        * Material on structural work, earthquake studies, structural
        engineering
    * Folder 28
        * "The Lagunita Water Project: Summary Report," Department of Civil
        Engineering
            * "capacity of existing Stanford reserviors as now operated is
            little more than adequate to satisfy the irrigation requirements of
            the campus. Present rate of withdrawal from the deep groundwater for
            domestic use exceeds the annual recharge and, unless corrective
            measures are taken, the deep groundwater may have to be abandoned in
            a relatively few years." (1)
        * Most of the records are about campus improvements, Lagunita Lake, streets,
        lights.
    * Folder 29
        * Material on faculty housing, Pine Hills subdivision
        * Demand for Pine Hills lots exceeded demand (Letter from Robert A.
        Walker to J. E. Sterling)
        * "Approved Standards for Properties and Residences on the Stanford
        Campus (Excluding Pine Hill)," Dec 5, 1958
            * Sets out standards for setbacks, minimum lot sizes, garages,
            swimming pools, accessory buildings, fences, walls, vents, height
            restrictions, garage and trash cans, landscaping -- most of which
            needed university approval.

        * "Development of Circulation and Parking for the Academic Campus of
        Stanford University"
        * "Stanford Planning," Eldridge T. Spencer, May 13, 1958 (circulated to
        the Buildings and Grounds Committee on May 14, 1958).
            * "One of the University's really permanent resources is its land.
            Several major universities of the world have run out of land, and
            been forced to handicap their needs and to pay for additional land
            on which to expand. The new freeway, proposed flood control dam, and
            Project M^[A proposal to build a linear accelerator underground near
            Foothill Road.] may occupy or render unusable as much as one thousand
            acres of Stanford land. In the past, Stanford's ability to attract
            important academic activities has been to some measure due to its
            available land. During the next century this may become increasingly
            true. It is important that land assignment be pointed toward
            providing a way of living conductive to the long term goals of the
            University." (1)
    * Folder 32
        * "Advisory Committee on Land and Building, Meeting Minutes," Nov 10,
        1959
            * "Mr. Brandin reported that the Ampex Corporation had withdrawn an
            earlier proposal for the use of Area 6 for a major development but
            was now interested in 80 acres, plus an option for perhaps 80 acres
            more, south of Foothill Road opposite the Veterans Administration
            Hospital. There was some discussion of a possible need for land in
            this area for academic purposes, particularly possible research
            programs related to Project M. It was indicated that sufficient land
            has been set aside for Project M to meet this need. The following
            motion was adopted: 'The Committee views the Ampex proposal as a
            good development in this area and recommends proceeding with
            negotiations.'" (2)
        * "Advisory Committee on Land and Building, Meeting Minutes," Oct 13,
        1959
            * "A proposal was presented by Mr. Brandin for the development of
            some 400 acres of Area 6 for low density, garden-type industrial
            use. The corporation making the proposal would develop the 150 acres
            at the outset, reserving 250 acres either for its own use or for
            development in accordance with the same kind of land use pattern."
            (1)
        * "Advisory Committee on Land and Building, Meeting Minutes," May 3,
        1960
            * "Mr. Brandin reported upon the developments in the proposed
            rezoning of the area involving the Ampex Plant. Mr. King, architect
            for Ampex, presented a new proposal for the Ampex layout, including a
            250-ft. greenbelt around the plant. As presented, it proposed a 20%
            building coverage of the site, 40% parking, and 40% landscaping. It
            was noted that the site plan would preserve the contour features of
            the land and that even the parking areas would involve no major
            reconfiguration of the land. . . . The Committee voted to recommend
            approval of the preliminary plan and of the proposed zoning." (1-2)

**Looking at material on 2014-01-24**:

* Box 25
    * Folder 37
        * Alf Brandin is a member of the Palo Alto chamber of commerce in
        1955/1956 (e.g., "Board of Directors Attendance at City Council
        Meetings," Mar 15, 1956.)
        * Letter from David Haight to Wallace Sterling, Dec 21, 1955
            * Haight passing along information that the Board of Directors of
            the PA Chamber of Commerce has issued a report from the
            Beautification Committee that mentions Stanford:
                * "1. Commend Stanford University for the decision to preserve
                the natural appearance of the foothills behind the campus and
                the native oak trees by extending the boundaries of the areas
                for future campus use." (1)
                * "2. Recommend to Stanford University that adequate green belt
                strips be preserved to landscape the areas bordering the
                Industrial Park, and that the native oak trees be preserved
                wherever possible in the professional, administrative and
                residential zones west of the Regional Shopping Center." (1)
            * Wallace responds in a letter to Haight (Jan 13, 1956)
                * "You can be sure that the recommendations regarding the green
                belt strips and the preservation of the oak trees in the
                professional, administrative and residential areas west of the
                regional shopping center will receive very careful consideration
                by the various committees working on the planning and developing
                of University lands." (1)
                * "We are striving to make our land development program
                something of which the community will be proud. In this we
                welcome the interest and assistance of our neighbors such as
                yourself." (1)
    * Folder 38
        * No material here that would be useful. Some correspondence with PA
        mayors, Alf Brandin.

* Box  58
    * Folder 21 "Committees - Advisory Committee on Land and Building
    Development"
        * Committees on Plant Development records; no use.
    * Folder 22 "Committees - Advisory Committee on Land and Building
    Development"
        * Document by George Knoles criticizing plans for Skidmore, Owings &
        Merrill, land developers (April 1954)
            * The planners "indicated that the 'Determination of types and
            characteristics of neighborhoods (residential areas, schools,
            recreation, park, civic and miscellaneous) to be developed in this
            project . . . will be guided by the basic concept that "the long
            term return in terms of highest standards of human environment is
            the ultimate goal."' A statement such as this is subject to a wide
            variety of interpretation. There is no evidence in the report to
            suggest that the planners have followed this basic concept." (1)
            * "Skidmore, Owings & Merrill failed to accept the challenge to deal
            originally and imaginatively with the lands at Stanford's disposal.
            In areas 5, 7, 8, and 9 in particular, the Master Plan reveals an
            over-concern with planning Stanford's lands to follow trends by
            other developers, rather than establishing Stanford's standards."
            (1)
                * I think these are comments in response to a report issued by
                Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. There are other documents in the
                folder responding to this as well.
        * Document by Robert A. Walker, Apr 22 1954
            * Skidmore, Owings & Merrill "have shown an understandable, but
            unacceptable, tendency to think of the Stanford lands as a vast
            potential subdivision which incidentally has a University occupying
            some of the area." (1)
            * "...if the aim of planning the Stanford lands is to maximize
            long-range income to the University, it is not at all clear that the
            plan would accomplish this." (1)
    * Folder 23 "Committees - Advisory Committee on Land and Building
    Development"
        * Re: Subcommittee of Messrs. Knoles, Spencer and Cuthbertson, Subj:
        Suggestions for Guiding Principles for the Further Development of the
        Stanford Lands
            * "2. Recognition of the opportunities and limitations of the
            physical environment, .i.e. climate, terrain, fauna, flora,
            creek-beds, rolling, flat lands, etc." (1)
            * "3. Recognition of the unique opportunities and pressures,
            economic, social and intellectual as well as physical, imposed on
            the University, and its environment by virtue of its location on the
            rim of the last frontier." (1)
            * "4. Acceptance of the responsibilities indicated in the founding
            grant to maintain a continuing and continually constructive approach
            toward the planning of the outer lands to avoid the pitfalls
            involved in an absentee attitude toward the lands." (1)
            * "6. Planning should recognize both the principles of
            _conservation_ and the principles of _use_. The decisions we make
            today should provide a continuous opportunity for flexible planning
            of all of the University lands." (1)
        * Map of Stanford Lands
        * Memorandum to Ray Faulkner from Ernest Hilgard
            * "I am increasingly impressed by the disadvantages of the bedroom
            community. The problems of smog are part of the story, related to
            highway congestion. No matter how highways are improved, downtown
            parking is going to be troublesome. The engineering difficulties are
            great. But the social problems for the commuter -- lost time,
            interrupted family life, lack of roots in the life of the community,
            are also serious. The economic problems are complex, but there is a
            kind of parasitical relationship to the larger city that is
            unsound." (1)
            * "I should like to see Stanford do something with its lands that
            will make people proud of us 100 years from now. We have an
            opportunity to be socially inventive, and we ought to seize that
            opportunity. It will not come, without great cost, after the lands
            are developed." (1)
