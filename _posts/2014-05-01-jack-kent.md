![Thomas "Jack" Kent](./img/tjkent.jpg)

Thomas "Jack" Kent was born in Oakland on January 30, 1917 to Thomas and Belinda
Kent. The family moved to San Francisco when Jack's father started practicing
architecture. Jack Kent earned a B.A. in architecture at the University of
California-Berkeley in 1938, and then studied with Lewis Mumford in Europe in
1938-1939 under a fellowship sponsored by his fraternity Beta Theta Pi.

In 1939, he was a founding member of Telesis, an organization of young urban
planners dedicated to making the Bay Area a more livable and healthier
environment. That same hear, he struck up a friendship with [Dorothy Erskine](),
a citizen activist, conservationist, and Telesis supporter. This would be the
start of a forty-year friendship and working together in various organizations
including [People for Open Space]().

In 1939, Kent began working as a junior planning assistant with the Marin County
Planning Commission, and moved to the office of I. S. Shattuck in 1940,
a traffic and planning firm in Oakland and, that same year, began working as an
assistant planning technician with the Pacific Southwest Regional Office of the
National Resources Planning Board. In 1941, he married Mary Chace Tolman,
daughter of the U.C. Berkeley Professor Edward Tolman and Kathleen Tolman, with
whom he has three sons between 1942 and 1949. In 1943, he earned his Masters of
City Planning degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

In 1943, he became the Associate City Planner for the San Francisco City
Planning Commission, but his service was cut short when he was drafted into the
United States Army. He served in Washington D.C. for the duration of the war. In
September 1945, Kent was assigned to the Office of Military Government for
Berlin, where he stayed until 1946. When he returned to California, he served as
Director of City Planning for San Francisco under Mayor Roger D. Lapham.

In 1948 Kent became the founding professor of the U.C. Berkeley Department of
City and Regional Planning, where he chaired until 1960 and remained until 1974.
During this time, Kent also was a member of the Berkeley City Planning
Commission (1948-1957) and was an active member of a faculty group opposing the
U.C. Loyalty Oath (1949-1955).

Kent played a role in establishing several influential organizations. In 1952 he
helped organize the Berkeley Grassrooters, an influential Democratic Club. In
1957, he was elected to Berkeley's City Council where he remained until 1966. In
1958, he helped found [People for Open Space](), a regional planning and
conservation group. In 1961, he helped found the [Association of Bay Area
Governments]() (ABAG).

Kent also continued to play a role in local politics. In addition to serving on
the Berkeley City Council until 1966, he served as a leader of the Berkeley
Council's first liberal Democratic majority, and led initiatives for Berkeley's Fair
Housing Ordinance and the Save the Bay campaign. He also authored influential
texts, including the *City and Regional Planning for the Metropolitan San
Francisco Bay Area* (1963), *The Urban General Plan* (1964), and the [kent1970openspace]() essay
(1970).

Between 1974 and 1978, he served as president of [People for Open Space]() and
remained active with U.C. Berkeley's Department of City and Regional Planning
and in civic activities in Berkeley.

Kent died on April 26, 1998, after heart failure and a long struggle with
Alzheimer's disease.
