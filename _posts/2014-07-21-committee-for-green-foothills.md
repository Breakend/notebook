They published a newsletter called *Green Footnotes*. Wallace Stegner was among
the founding members and elected honorary president.

[They describe](http://www.greenfoothills.org/about/) their history:

> In 1959 a band of citizens in the Palo Alto-Los Altos Hills area organized with
the specific purpose of keeping the “factories out of the foothills.” The
catalyst for their concern: a proposal by Stanford University to annex 254 acres
to Palo Alto in order to allow industrial development west of what is now
Foothill Expressway — but was then a small road winding along the foot of the
hills. A referendum was held to decide the issue, but the opposition was well
organized, and the pro-open space forces lost.

> Three years passed during which it became clear that the foothills would
disappear if a concerted effort were not made to save them. In May of 1962, Lois
Crozier-Hogle gathered 27 citizens from this first open space battle for a
meeting at Ruth Spangenberg’s home. The group decided that evening to organize
to preserve the foothills — thus Committee for Green Foothills was begun.

> The group elected as their first president Wallace Stegner, novelist and then
head of creative writing at Stanford University. He wrote the “Wilderness
Letter,” which was instrumental in voicing the intrinsic worth of wilderness. He
remained an active supporter and spokesman for CGF for the rest of his life.
