> Brandin, Alf, typescript of an oral history conducted by Bob DeRoos, Regional Oral History Office, The Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley, n.d., 103 pp.

p. 15: Brandin was 33 years old when he was hired by Stanford in January 1946.

p. 15: "You were like a city manager. The office [of business management] was responsible for sewer, and water services too, all that sort of thing. We handled all the insurance, all the business side of the University."

p. 15: Started out in insurance training, an experience that gave him "exposure to business, handling workmen's compensation, and public liability, legal problems, auditing problems, and production problems and all the rest of it. That was a very broad, remarkable training."

p. 16: Spent time as a skipper of a navy flight school in Ogden, Utah.

p. 17: Undergraduate work at Stanford.

p. 25: "recognizing that knowing a little bit about the finances of the University, I could never understand why we didn't do something with the land."

p. 27: Students attacked Brandin because "I was the bad guy because I was part of the military business complex, leasing buildings to people who were doing research for military purposes and all that sort of thing."

p. 27: Report of a bomb going off next to the house of the director of personnel.

p. 30: "We could lease it out [the land]. What I didn't understand was that there weren't yet enough people interested. Before the war, there wasn't the growth that we had later."

p. 31: "First of all, the Varian Associates came out here after World War II. They went to San Carlos and they set up shop there. Their birthday, incidentally, is my birthday, July 1."

p. 31: Notes that at the first birthday celebration of Varian Associates Brandin gets an idea: "I thought, 'They're leasing out there, why don't we try to take the hint and do something with some of our land? We could start an industrial park.'"

p. 31: "Now, the word 'industrial' to anybody who came from the East connotes smoke, and manufacturing, and all this sort of stuff that wasn't what we really had in mind."

p. 32: "Our fifty acres of industrial land was more land by a factor of three than Palo Alto had ever developed."

p. 32: Noting design ideas, thinking the park could be "screened off by trees."

p. 32: Notes his ideas about thinking a shopping center needed to exist on the Midpeninsula. "And everybody, if you needed anything, would go to San Francisco at least three, four, five, six, maybe ten, twenty times a year to do their shopping to the major department stores. . . . Why don't we bring some San Francisco down here?"

p. 33: Notes there was resistance to the idea that the Board of Trustees would ever support the establishment of a shopping center or industrial park, even Coldwell.

p. 33: "We were developing down that Peninsula, we were growing. I thought there was enough population to attract people."

p. 33: Calls Caldwell the "dean of the real estate people."

p. 35: Originally leased some of the land to flower growers. Grew flax, hay, all sorts of things to try and increase rents from farm operations.

p. 35: Russ Varian comes to Brandin noting they wanted to move into the Stanford area.

n.p. [35]: "We opened in sections, even while we were under construction. The Emproium and Roos Brothers were the first stores along what we called Building C. There were three stores in there and Roos Brothers was the first. That gave us money to keep going, so we didn't have to dig into the coffers; that helped." Macy's also an early tenant.

n.p. [36]: Brandin explaining his pitch to merchants; he'd say: "Listen, I have to tell you something. This town is growing. If it doesn't happen here it's going to happen below us and you really will be hurt. We're going to attract certain people that went to San Francisco, and you're going to attract the people you've always attracted. Plus the fact that you're going to get a lot of these people who are staying home; they will still do business with you. You will prosper from this. You won't be hurt. You won't be killed."

n.p. [38]: "We tried to say it has got to be clean, no smoke, no heavy manufacturing. Light manufacturing that is clean and electronic. The Varians were just coming in by this time. Eastman Kodak was coming in. We wanted to put it in a park-like atmosphere."

n.p. [39]: "garden-like buildings and they were highly landscaped. They were clean."

n.p. [39]: "We got into trouble when we started across Foothill and got into what was the rolling hills. The neighbors in Los Altos, for instance, complained." Tells a story of a pilot and his wife coming to his office to say they heard Stanford wouldn't develop the area. Apparently, a real estate broker told them Stanford would never develop the land because they can't sell it. **An expectation of countryside?**

n.p. [41]: The industrial park was roughly 100--165 acres, and believed "that industry wouldn't go on the rolling hills."

n.p. [42]: David Packard comes to Alf mentioning they want to expand their operations and asks for 20 acres of land at the Park (later, this expands to 40 acres).

n.p. [43]: "We wanted to go across Foothill Boulevard into the area that's called Coyote Hill. This is when we ran into a stumbling block with the people that lived across from Arastradero Road. They didn't want the property to be developed as I think I've told you before."

n.p. [44]: "We were annexing the properties in the industrial area on the basis of the use of the property, piece by piece."

n.p. [44]: "But when we went across Foothill Boulevard, the Los Altos people rejected it. The referendum was in Palo Alto---we annexed the properties to Palo Alto, we were in the county. The referendum was sponsored by the people who adjoined the university and the people in Palo Alto who felt that the wrong thing to do is to develop the hills that they could see from Palo Alto."

n.p. [46]: "So we had a referendum. It was bitterly fought referendum. I think that the University (and I took the lead for the University), and I were the bad guys. I was on the first and second page of the paper for something like 72 days. In any event, it took a lot of effort and energy and a lot of money. We won the referendum."

n.p. [46]: "The same thing [opposition] happened with Oregon Avenue, with the problem of widening Oregon Avenue."

n.p. [46]: "This all developed over a period of time and every time we zoned an additional piece in the industrial area, the people began to become more and more concerned about it. It was harder and harder. Finally the city wanted us to zone the whole area at once."

n.p. [46]: Brandin notes they needed money to run the university.

n.p. [49]: "The beginning of the Industrial Park started with Russ Varian, who developed the Klystron tube here at Stanford. They were back at Harvard with Fred Terman in his group working for the war department."

n.p. [49]: Russ Varian visited Brandin's office "and said that they had outgrown their space and would like to be someplace on the Stanford property near their associates in the physics department and the research facilities."

n.p. [51]: Refers to Coldwell as a "counselor" to the Research Park.
