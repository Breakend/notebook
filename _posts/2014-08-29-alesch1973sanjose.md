> Daniel J. Alesch and Robert Levine, *Growth in San Jose: A Summary Policy
Statement*, 1973.

p. iii: A report from a year and a half study about "the causes and effects of rapid
economic and demographic growth" in San Jose and "policy strategies for
control of that growth."

p. v: The study is part of Rand's Urban Policy Program.

p. v: The study focused on two issues:

  1. The "potential dilemma" of perceived "dependence on growth for private
     and public prosperity" and the "undesirable effects of rapid growth in
     causing 'urban sprawl' and other environmental deterioration."
  2. The effects of rapid growth on the "relative status of the main minority
     population in the area (Mexican-Americans) versus the Anglo majority."

p. vi: The report summarizes two findings:

  1. The first issue is being resolved "by changes over time in economic and
     population growth -- prosperity no longer depends on rapid growth" and
     additional sprawl "seems acceptable" to most local residents.
  2. Rapid growth has improved the absolute income of minorities but "have
     done little or nothing to improve the minority's relative status as
     compared to the majority." This "may be the major problem in San Jose's
     future."
