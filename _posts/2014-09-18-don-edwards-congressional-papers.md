### Notes

**On January 15, 2013, looking at the Don Edwards Papers at SJSU:**

Box 72, Folder 3: Alvison General 1966:

- Letter from ACCION to Edwards, March 18, 1966 (2pp)
- ACCION "Platform Ideas" n.d., ALVISON CITIZENS' COMMITTEE TO INSURE
  OPPORTUNITY NOW BOX 74 (1p) (72:3: Alviso General 1966)
- Letter from William Slocumb to Don Edwards, Mar 30, 1966 (2pp) (72:3:
  Alvison General 1966)
    - Slocumb is a real estate broker.
    - Writing about the "complete frustration of our efforts in Alviso" and
    the "two key road blocks" of "the tendency to pass the buck to the Army
    Engineers" and "the reluctance of the local FHA office to look at the
    entire project as an integral means to an end." (1)
    - Writes that action is needed in Washington to convince the FHA to act,
    and to convince the FHA that "existing blight can only be eradicated
    through the bold and imaginative creation of a new image for the entire
    Alviso area through the use of Title X loan program with a coordinated
    effort with urban renewal a natural *outgrowth* of the new development
    rather than a prerequisite thereto." (1-2)
    - The population of Alviso is estimated at 1100. A Title X program "would
    finance construction for 5000 to 7000 new residents who undoubtedly would
    require the city to get on the right track."
- Letter from Bill Zanker to Don Edwards, Feb 11, 1966 (1p) (72:3:
  Alviso General 1966)
    - Zanker responding to Edwards' letter from Feb. 3, 1966 regarding the
    Corps of Engineers study.
    - "The prime reason for writing to you was the hope that you could hurry
    the process along in getting the Army Engineers to act. I now can see that
    things are still at the local level. This was a point very carefully
    evaded by local officials." *[What does he mean here? That nothing can be
    done on Edwards' end because he believed that local officials had moved on
    to actually making things happen?]*
    - If the Corps cannot get to issue a report until 1967, Zanker worries
    that the city can't get financial assistance because of persistent
    flooding problems, and the Corps won't be acting on these issues anytime
    soon either.
    - Zanker says the issue will get worse and worse: "as the eastside grows
    with more and more sub-divisions, there will be more and more storm water
    draining into the Coyote so that those of us who do live here will be in
    even greater danger from flooding." *[In other words, expansion in east
    San Jose is threatening Alviso because the infrastructure isn't in place
    to accomodate the growth.]*
    - Zanker notes that the 1958 flood, when the Coyote flooded, it reached
    the height of the Guadalupe levees and poured into the channel resulting
    in the flood level remaining constant. "Those same levees are a lot higher
    today, so if the Coyote does flood, the town will really catch it."
- Letter from J. Frank Pendergast to City Council Alviso (1p), August 17, 1965
    - Writing to the Alviso city council regarding the consideration of several
    residential developments for FHA mortgage insurance purposes. (1)
    - They are refusing the proposals because of "existing adverse
    environmental factors, lack of adequate local codes and ordinances, and
    serious engineering problems of drainage and subsidence." These problems
    led to the property being too risky for FHA mortage insurance.
    - The only possibility for FHA's participation would be under Section 220,
    which falls under comprehensive urban renewal program and Pendergast
    believes that it "is the only practical method of solving your overall
    problems."
- Letter from Milo Lacy to Lloyd Fowler, September 15, 1965
    - Letter to the district engineer with the Santa Clara County Flood
    Control and Water District (Lloyd Fowler)
    - Letter noting that the Alviso Development Corporation is interested in
    developing 274 acres for a planned community development for residential,
    business, professional, schools, and parks.
    - Letter notes that the FHA is interested in knowing more about the flood
    control protection in the area especially in relation to recent County
    improvements to the Guadalupe and Coyote channels and dikes around Alviso.
- Letter from Lloyd Fowler to Milo Lacy, September 20, 1965
    - Responding to a September 15 1965 letter regarding a Planned Community
    Development north of Alviso-Milpital Road and west of Zanker Road for
    potential flooding.
    - The Alviso area was originally a tidal flat (1)
    - Fowler notes that there is concern about subsidence "causing internal
    drainage problems. All storm drain outfalls to natural channels must be
    flapgated and are inoperable during times of high tides." (2) **[The
    subsidence issue is important to a lot of this; drainage problems are part
    of the issue, but it also causes infrastructure issues (broken pipes,
    etc.)]** (2)
- Congressional Record, Remarks from Don Edwards, September 27, 1965
- Zanker to Edwards, Dec 27, 1965
    - Pleading with Edwards to help get new funds for flood control efforts,
    even though Alviso is not in Edwards' district.
    - The Santa Clara County Flood Control District wants to turn over control
    to the Corps of Engineers.
    - Zanker pleads that Alviso is "in a desperate situation" but the city is
    "trying . . . to work with what we have and to raise ourselves up to where
    we can look our sister cities squarely in the eye." [Is this an indication
    that Alviso is trying to avoid annexation or consolidation with
    surrounding cities?]
- Edwards to Zanker, Feb 3, 1966
    - Edwards responding to Zanker's Dec. 27 1965 letter.
    - Notes that he was in touch with the Corps of Engineers and he quotes
    their response.
    - The Corps noted that Alviso and surrounding agricultural areas flooded
    in December 1955, April 11958, and February 1963, to depths as much as
    five inches and for as long as 17 days.
    - After the 1963 flood, Santa Clara County Flood Control and Water
    Conservation District constructed levees on the Guadalupe River that
    helped with flooding, but the Alviso Slough still remains a potential for
    flooding the town. Additionally, floodwaters from the Coyote Creek will
    also cause damage to the town.
    - The Corps reports that it is studying the possibility of providing flood
    protective measures for Alviso under the Flood Control Act of 1941, which
    would include reservoir flood-control storage and channel improvements.
    The Corps estimates its investigation will conclude in November 1967.
- Brown to Zanker, Feb 24, 1966
    - Responding to Zanker's Dec. 27 1965 letter.
    - Brown tells Zanker that the Corps of Engineers is studying the issue and
    plans to issue a report in 1967. Only after the report is produced will
    the "state of California . . . review the proposed improvements and, if
    the project is economically justified and in the best interest of the
    state, will urge action by the Corps of Engineers."
    - The state provides assistance by reimbursements for the costs of lands
    and rights-of-way associated with federal flood control.
- Zanker to Brown, Dec 27, 1965
    - Similar plea to the Edwards Dec. 27 1965 letter, asking the governor for
    help with Alviso's flooding problems.
- Silvera to Edwards, June 30, 1966
    - Silvera is the mayor of Alviso.
- Zanker to Edwards, June 17, 1966
    - Zanker writes that the Santa Clara Flood Control District is issuing a
    report in August. From what Zanker has learned, the Corps report "was not
    going to be too encouraging," the biggest problem being the cost of the
    project.
    - Zanker notes that Alviso is looking for a city manager, but the budget
    being low means they're looking for an engineer-manager.
