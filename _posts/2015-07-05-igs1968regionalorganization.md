Report of the September 14, 1968, conference presented by IGS at Berkeley and the Joint Committee on Bay Area Regional Organization

p. xi: The conference meant to assemble citizens to guide the work of the Joint Committee on Bay Area Regional Organization. Conference attended by 750 persons at Wheeler Auditorium in Berkeley.

p. xi: The conference organized around six topics: regional planning, problems of the poor, environmental quality, using and saving the Bay, open space, and transportation.

## Introduction

Edited remarks given by Eugene C. Lee, Director of IGS, Berkeley

p. 3: "Certainly, this is one of the most significant programs of legislative-University cooperation ever conducted."

p. 4:

> Let me add only one final and pesonal note, which you may accept or reject.
> The question today is not whether there should be regional government or
> organization in the Bay Area. That question was decided a long time ago. We
> already have regional government. Simply to cite the alphabet soup of
> regional agencies illustrates this point: ABAG, BART, BCDC, BATS, EMBUD,
> WQCB; each of these is a regional agency of one sort or another. Add to these
> the state and federal government programs in the region. The question is not
> whether we have regional organization, but what kind. Can we govern ourselves
> more effectively? This is the issue before us.

Edited remarks given by John T. Knox, Assemblyman of 11th district, Richmond, and chairman of the Joint Committee on Bay Area Regional Organization.

## Metropolitan Areas and Current Realities

"Metropolitan Areas and Current Realities," John W. Gardner, Chairman, The Urban Coalition and Former Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare

p. 9:

> One of the most significant things happening in this nation today is the
> reexamination and redesign of relations between the federal government and
> regional, state, or local instrumentalities. As with most significant
> advances in human affairs, this has not been voluntary. We were driven to it
> by the sheer unworkability of the existing system.

p. 9: Sees the reexamination happening by two sets of functions: taxation and allocation of resources among levels of government; and, distribution of governmental functions and their relationships.

p. 10:

> One must understand the extraordinary lack of coordination among the federal
> agencies concerned with the domestic side of government. One must have seen
> and worked with the multiple uncoordinated federal grant programs. One must
> have observed the absence of state, regional, and local instrumentalities
> capable of comprehensive planning, capable of pulling together the federal
> fragments, capable of linking geographically related efforts. One must have
> observed the grave inadequacies of local government and its incapacity, under
> the best circumstances, to cope with federal and state initiatives. One must
> have seen the incredible fragmentation of metropolitan areas, the fiscal
> starvation of every major city, and the failure of local leadership, in and
> out of government.

pp. 10-11: Suggests that these are all interrelated, and had the effect of boxing-in localities. Tells the story of his time at Health, Education, and Welfare, where they took fifteen narrow categories for health programs and packaged them into a single piece of legislation ("The Partnership in Health") where funds were distributed to governors as a block grant plus planning money, allowing the localities to figure out the needs of their state.

p. 11: "This devolution of initiative to the state and local levels is in the spirit of the times, and must be pursued with greater energy in the years ahead."

p. 11: Adds that he's not "encouraging the old conservative fantasy that the Washington bureaucracy might somehow be made to wither away. . . . But Washington must be alert to the conditions that produce vitality and strength at lower levels of government."

pp. 11-12: "I'm going to ask you to widen your perspective from the heart of the metropolitan area out to the suburbs, the surrounding countryside, and ultimately the total land space of the nation."

p. 12:

> Within the past 20 years the urge on the part of large numbers of people to
> pile into the cities has become wholly anachronistic. For 10,000 years,
> people had excellent reasons to crowd themselves into cities. Only there
> could they find the richness and variety of stimulation that make for
> creativity. Only there could they find the massed resources and economies of
> scale that make possible the greatest enterprises. Today, thanks to advances
> in communication, transportation, and the arts of organization, we can
> provide those conditions at any point on the map that strikes our fancy.

p. 12: "How can we best use the land space of the nation? What patterns of settlement and open space best serve our purposes? How can we revitalize rural areas, create new cities, and overhaul existing cities in ways that serve human needs, the requirements of economic vitality, and the claims of beauty?"

## Summary of Discussion: Regional Planning

p. 48: The workshop on regional planning summarized as:

> Planning is no longer a dirty word with ivory-tower connotations, but has
> become instead a simple matter of survival for the Bay Area and its
> localities. The psychological barriers of the past have tumbled and have
> given way to some sense of common destiny.

## Background Paper: Issues in Regional Planning

"Background Paper: Issues in Regional Planning for the Bay Area," Paul Sedway, Partner, Sedway/Cooke, Urban and Regional Planners, San Francisco

p. 52: Defines regional planning as "a tool for developing rational policies, plans, and programs to anticipate and solve areawide problems."

p. 53: "As elsewhere in the United States, regional planning in the Bay Area has been one of the major responses to areawide problems and an early symbol of cooperative endeavor."

p. 54:

> "The most important developments in regional planning have taken place in the
> last decade. In 1961, the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) was
> created under the Joint Exercise of Powers Act. ABAG decided to initiate
> a continuing program of regional planning, with permanent staff. In addition,
> various Bay Area study commissions, with a defined life-span, have been
> created by special legislation to investigate, prepare plans for selected
> regional matters, and suggest organizational structure and necessary powers.
> Notable among these are: the Bay Area Rapid Transit Study Commission (the
> predecessor to the present BART District), the Bay Area Transportation Study
> Commission (BATSC), the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development
> Commission (BCDC), and the San Francisco Bay-Delta Study (Bay-Delta)."

p. 57: "Clearly, regional planning in the Bay Area has been concerned primarily with the form of physical development that would efficiently accommodate future growth." Yet this emphasis is criticized for overlooking issues of urban poverty, racial city-suburb friction, and equal opportunity for jobs and housing.

p. 57: "One implication of such criticism [housing, etc.] is that regional planning should given greater recognition to social problems and goals."

p. 61: Suggests a different emphasis in planning studies, says to think of metropolitan areas separately from local planning. "Instead of the typical land use, transportation, and public facility designations, the metropolitan plan might include a more generalized sketch showing an 'end-direction' of spatial arrangements, and relative concentration of persons and activity."

p. 61-62: A study by IGS among regional leaders indicated that the major issues facing the Bay Area were: 1) mass transportation; 2) Bay conservation and development; 3) solid waste disposal; 4) air pollution; 5) airports, 6) water quality control; 7) regional parks and recreation; 8) regional planning; 9) conservation of open space; 10) housing and urban redevelopment; 11) public health programs; 12) social welfare planning; 13) sewage disposal; 14) police protection; 15) education; 16) too many governments; 17) racial conflict; 18) unemployment.

p. 63: ABAG does not have the power to secure local conformance.

p. 63: Cites "The Effectiveness of Metropolitan Planning" by MIT-Harvard Center for Urban Studies outlining three alternatives to local power: 1) require local governmens to adhere to the regional plan; 2) require local conformance with regional recommendations that affect local proposals; the regional agency would rely on the submission of review proposals to ensure conformance; 3) assume no statutory compulsion for local conformance, permitting regional and local appeals to a higher authority that could pass judgements when jurisdiction is invoked.

p. 64: "A regional planning agency with a relatively broad range of responsibilities should be able to influence the location, timing, and extent of development by private and other public agencies, as well as to secure sites for its own facilities and operations."

## Summary of Discussion: Problems of the Poor

p. 71: One of the key themes emerging from the workshop is the "importance of securing effective representation and participation of the poor in both local and regional governmental activity."

p. 79: A suggestion that city dwellers seek a "community of interest with suburbanites." The predominantly nonwhite cities and predominantly white suburbs could become allies in the distribution of resources. "Presently, both groups tend to be suspicious of regional government. Possibly the city dwellers could work out a sort of give-and-take with suburban voters: 'You vote to help with problems of the central city and we will vote to help protect you from air and water pollution.'"

## Background Paper: Regional Government: Impact on the Poor

"Background Paper: Regional Government: Impact on the Poor," Willie L. Brown, Jr., Assemblyman, 18th District, San Francisco

p. 85:

> Many times over we have seen that the affluent suburbanites have vigorously
> opposed regional government primarily on grounds that it represents
> a redistribution scheme favoring the central cities (the poor). On the other
> hand, the poor, and especially the black population, see regional government
> as a potent threat to the continued existence of the central municipalities,
> where major gains in political power have recently been made.

p. 85: Suggests that regional government can be a positive social instrument.

p. 86: "...proponents of multifunctional regional government do not look with disfavor upon the legitimate functions of the city and county governments, for many governmental problems are still best suited to local solution. Rather, they are disturbed by the piecemeal, nonvisible, uncoordinated, nonrepresentative, and generally ineffective efforts of special-purpose districts to adapt to the growing number of metropolitan-areawide social and environmental problems."

p. 87: Argues that while affluent communities and the poor will both enjoy clean air, clean water, cleanup of trash, parks and open space, the poor will prioritize education, jobs, neighborhood health, and housing, recognizing that "their ability to enjoy the beauties of the outdoor environment depends upon access, on the ability to get there in the first place."

p. 87: "a regional government that concentrates solely on environmental issues distorts the potential of regionalism. The poor will not support such a distortion."

## Summary of Discussion: Environmental Quality

p. 104: The "environmental crisis" has three policy problems: 1) solid wastes, 2) air pollution, 3) water pollution.

"Background Paper: Pollution or Purity? Air, Water, Solid Wastes," Frank M. Stead, Consultant in Environmental Management and Former Chief, Division of Environmental Sanitation, California State Department of Public Health

p. 114: "faced with the spectre of a Bay Area no longer resembling the 'Garden of Eden' they once knew, citizens are voicing opposition to this laissez-faire policy in a ground swell of protest, and it now seems unmistakably clear that they will not settle for a second-class environment."

p. 115: On air quality, quoting a report from the Air Resources Board, "Proposal for the Division of California into Air Basins,"

> The San Francisco Bay Area and associated valleys constitute a well-defined
> zone, somewhat broken into subparts in terms of wind climatology. Rather low
> hills, the influence of the large water areas of the bays, and a large influx
> of maritime air produce several well-defined wind patterns in the area.
> During much of the year, the winds coming in from the sea divide to flow
> northward into the Sonoma and Napa Valleys, eastward through Carquinez
> Strait, and southward into the Santa Clara Valley. As on other coastal areas,
> the subsidence inversion (effective lid or ceiling), is dominant over this
> area most of the year. It varies seasonally and daily between 1,000 and 3,000
> feet elevation. Due to solar heating the inversion may be destroyed over the
> extreme ends of the Sonoma and Santa Clara Valleys, and wide variations in
> vertical mixing occur over the extreme ends of these valleys. Except during
> the late summer and October, and during spells in April, May or June, wind
> movement provides consistent ventilation in much of the Bay Area.

p. 116: The main wastes discharged into the air are sulfur oxides, organic gases, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The primary source of air pollution is automobiles.

pp. 116--117: The primary sources of Bay Area water come from the Mokelumne and Tuolumne River headwaters; the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers froming the Suisun Bay (major source of fresh water for industrial processing over the century); and the estuarine system "whose ecology was characterized by a tremendous quantity and diversity of marine life, and thus offered almost unlimited opportunities, both quantitatively and qualitatively, for outdoor recreation."

p. 118: Solid wastes had been disposed of in low-lying areas, compacting the waste into 10 foot thick layers and covering them with clean dirt in a process called a "sanitary landfill." But with the urban expansion of the Bay Area, disposal of solid wastes began happening in the Bay itself (which also had the process of creating new land.)

## Summary of Discussion: Open Space

p. 156: The workshop participants agree that counties have done a poor job protecting open space, that "subdivisions are gobbling up land by leaps and bounds, and that a regional organization is needed to plan for and preserve open space on a regional basis."

p. 158: Workshop participants want to see social planning and environmental planning brought together.

"Background Paper: Open Space for the Region," Harold Gilliam, Author, Conservation Columnist

p. 169: "our region's very attractiveness threatens to be fatal; it draws increasing numbers of people who need land for living, working, shopping, and transportation---land that is subtracted from the region's heritage of natural open space."

pp. 169--170: "Hillsides are graded for housing; groves and orchards are bulldozed for subdivisions; and large areas of the Bay itself are filled for housing tracts, airports, and shopping centers."

p. 170: Says that there's an annual loss of open space amounting to 13,440 acres, "an area half the size of San Francisco."

p. 171: Suggests that open space is important not only because it satisfies recreational demands, but because it is important to public interest. Those interests were outliend by the Urban-Metropolitan Open Space Study prepared by Eckbo, Dean, Austin & Williams for the State Office of Planning. They outlined:

1) resource production (forestry, agriculture, mineral production, animal products, water supply, commercial and recreation fishing and marine life production);
2) preservation of natural and human resources (water, tideland, and marshland areas for fish and wildlife; woods and forests for wildlife refuge; geological features; historical and cultural sites);
3) health, welfare, and well-being (protecting quality of ground water; open space for disposal of sewage and garbage; improvement of airshed quality; areas for recreation; areas for recreational travel; waterways; scenic highways; areas providing visual amenity (hillsides, mountains, valleys, lakes);
4) open space for public safety (flood control reservoirs, flood plains, drainage channels; unstable soil areas; airport flight path zones; fire zones;)
5) Open space for corridors (power transmission lines; canals, conduit, and aqueduct ways; transportation and transit ways)
6) Open space for urban expansion (areas for commerce and industry; lands for housing and public service facilities)

pp. 178--182: How can open space be preserved? Acquisition in fee; less-than-fee acquisition; scenic easements; development rights; trail easements; subdivision ordinances; zoning ordinances; public works; assessment and taxation.

p. 187: "It is argued, then, that the expense of maintaining parks and open spaces to be enjoyed by residents of the entire region should be borne by the region. Counties with a narrow tax base should not be expected to provide for the rest of the region."

p. 190: "only comprehensive planning---balancing the needs of the whole region for urbanization, transportation, and open space---can devise solutions for such conflicts and thus guarantee an effective open space program."
