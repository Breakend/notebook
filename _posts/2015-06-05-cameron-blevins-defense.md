Cameron Blevins' dissertation defense, Lane History Corner, 12:30p

Starting out with Census atlas maps from 1870

- What's missing? The West. Only two of the maps show the West, and focus on the narrow strip of coast along California.
- 1890 Census atlas maps -- western focused.
- Using these maps to drive home the speed of this integration of the West into the rest of the nation.

Cannot understand this process without understanding the U.S. Post. The Post as midwife of the West. The hidden spatial infrastructure of the West.

Explaining the interpretive core

- What was the Post?
- Spatial History
- Government and Commerce

## What was the Post

Why the Pony Express? (Dime novels, movies, early '90s film, Google)

The PE was a trenemdous failure without any connection to the US Post.

"And we all know what happened to those ponies." (picture of Elmer's glue)

No other institution reached people the way the Post did: Not the railroads, not churches, not Republicans.

## Spatial History

Building a new methodology: A Postal Geography. Using the Post to determine where people were.

The Postal Geography is important because there are major gaps in our knowledge about where people are at in the West.

*Urbanism and Empire in the Far West* Eugene Moehring

Filling in the gaps of thousands of western communities. Where people lived and for how long.

What is spatial history?

- important theoretical framework for historians
- space can mean: geographic space (arrangement of features on the earth's surface); socially constructed space (actively produced by people: human relationships, practices, movements)
- Silicon Valley exists on a map but most probably don't think of the Santa Clara Valley---you think of iPhones, etc. This is actively produced and reproduced.

The Post was an important shaper of these socially constructed spaces.

Example of the Talbert post office

- Geographic space
- But also constructed
	- Building started as a general store. When he became the postmaster the space became publicaly accessible, sanctioned by the government.
	- movement into and out of the building---constructed the bulding as a socially defined space.
	- the meaning of the building changed once it became a post office
	- this social space produced in thousands of places

## Government and Commerce

Argues a particular kind of space central to the West, centralized around government and commerce.

Gossamer Network

- Post office didn't own or operate the postal network, it contracted with private companies.
- Graphed public functions onto existing operations.
- Mail routes and post offices, fundamentally.

Understanding the American State means understanding the Post. Shed light on American governance in the nineteenth century.

Americans celebrate ideas about their hsitory. The government is invisible, a weak nineteenth century state.

Not just reinterpreting the size of American government, but also how it operated. Sometimes the job of a historian is to show now strange history is. We're conditioned to see the state as a public entity, and official government spaces.

But nineteenth century state was not a bureaucracy, but blurred public and private. Both governance and commerce. The ability to expand and reced explains the West's growth. Many ghost towns in the West. Very unstable, only one out of three lasted more than ten years.

"The post were the arteries that pumped blood through the West."

The Post carried newspapers, magazines, and periodicals, money orders. Not just letters. It connected westerners to a national system of inforamtion.

Hybrid space of public service and private enterprise

- The space of the American State in the nineteenth century
- Produced space across a range of spatial scales.
- Way of understanding these different scales of human experience---institutions and individuals. Structured the lives of Americans, connected to larger system of governance, law, politics, commerce. Made up of tiny small scale connections.
