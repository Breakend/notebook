> The Arnold Del Carlo Photograph Collection consists of photographs and negatives, which document the transformation of Santa Clara Valley from orchards to an urban landscape. The years covered by the collection range from the late 1940s to the early 1970s, and include photographs taken from the street level as well as from the air.

Notes
-----

The photograph collection is digitized; I'll have to go through the photos and see if there's anything useful here for illustration. (2014-03-19)
