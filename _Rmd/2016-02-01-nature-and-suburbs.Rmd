I'm thinking a lot about the potential directions that this project can go. At
its core, I still keep thinking about these contested but overlapping
landscapes and the ways that conflict shaped the area's identity and thinking
about "nature." I want to document a few threads I am trying to follow.

## Nature and Silicon Valley: The Bird's Eye View

Looking at the patterns of environmental thought and conservation in the Bay
Areas as a whole, there are patterns that reflect other nationwide trends or
follow specific regional and state-wide trends.

## Nature and Silicon Valley: At the Neighborhood View

There are, I think, a few things I can conclude about the importance of
neighborhoods in the story:

1. I see the suburbs having a far larger impact on modern
   environmentalism that other historians have given credit. I echo the
   claim of others, including [sellers2013crabgrass](),
   [hayden2000suburban](), and [rome2001bulldozer](). Many of the
   environmental organizations I look at can trace their origins to
   suburban homeowners who became particularly concerned about the
   industrialization of the Santa Clara Valley and began to question
   whether the benefits outweighed the detriments.
2. [walker2008countrycity]() makes the claim that the Bay Area is
   exceptionally "green" and tries to document how that came to be. He
   claims that conservationists and environmentalists in the Bay Area
   were particularly attuned to the environment. His story tends to
   focus on elites (which he readily admits) but the story sometimes
   reads like a laundry list of people and environmental organizations.
3. Environmentalism in Silicon Valley moves through phases. The first
   begins in the early 1950s that attempted to protect farmland from
   urban expansion.  Farmland served two roles, the first as food
   producer, and the second aesthetic. The next phase remained concerned
   about the disappearance of the countryside, but became much more
   concerned about industry's impact on that landscape. The third phase
   entered the realm of slow-growth and no-growth activism that
   advocated the end of urban sprawl and strict limits on
   industrialization. The fourth and final phase (in my study) focuses
   on public health and environmental justice, finding the toxic leaks
   and heavy use of chemicals among the supposed "clean" industries to
   be a significant threat to families and neighborhoods. Through each
   of these phases, the paramount concern always remained neighborhoods
   and homeowners.
4. In many cases, neighborhoods led the way in defining environmental
   thought: contests with Stanford; contests with industrial parks;
   contests with businesses. The question is *why* they took such an
   interest in defining the landscape. [davis1999quartz]() has argued,
   for Los Angeles, it centered around property rights and the
   protection of private property. I see it differently, that activism
   by neighborhood organizations reflects a genuine concern about the
   environment (*Ã  la* [rome2001bulldozer]()---but that concern is defined
   in very specific ways. Boosters and environmentalists often touted
   climate and beauty in their motivations for conservation. In some
   ways that could be viewed as a protection of property values, but I
   feel the expression of environmental thought actually springs from
   wanting to experience "nature"---physically through recreation and
   "picturesque" views. The protection of a countryside landscape
   becomes a desired feature of suburbanites up and down the
   Peninsula---zoning lot sizes, preservation of open space,
   establishment of parks, conservation of farmland. These become
   manifestations of an impulse to see the environment as something
   worth preserving. But this is imbued by culture, also.
5. There's also an element of historical memory I'm still trying to work
   through. There's a memory about the Valley of Heart's Delight that
   is embedded in some environmental critiques, and continues to play
   out well into the 1970s.

## Potential Directions

All of these findings have presented me with a few directions I could take as
the project moves forward.

What do all of these sources point to?

- a way to understand environmentalism?
- a way to explore the growth of environmentalism in suburbs?
- a new way of understanding shifting perceptions about nature and cities?
- examining more closely the role of "beauty" and "aesthetics" and
"countryside" in the story of Silicon Valley?
- [klingle2003emerald]() speaks of an "ethic of place" with regard to Seattle. Does
something similar happen in Santa Clara Valley?

I have also been thinking recently that my work could fit within the new
emphasis on the history of capitalism. Richard White stated at the History of
Capitalism Conference (2014) stated that:

> "Capitalism has not only affected nature, but has set the very terms of
what counts as nature."
(via @[cdc29](https://twitter.com/cdc29/status/530759547053674496))^[Also, via @[heathwcarter](https://twitter.com/heathwcarter/status/530754356275335168):
"Richard White speaking on how nature fits in hist of capitalism at
#HOC2014: commodity, capital, exogenous to economy, ecosystem
services."]

This, in some ways, also strikes a chord with the sort of things I am working
on. Industry in Silicon Valley does attempt to define what counts as
nature---from the well-groomed lawns around Stanford University to the planned
industrial parks in south San Jose. But maybe it goes beyond what industry
considered nature. How do debates over city parks reflect competing ideas about
nature? How do debates about protected lands, state and county parks,
wilderness areas, and recreational facilities shape ideas about "nature"? Even
beyond the cultural aspects, does the shaping of nature factor into capital and
commodity flows or vice versa (e.g., [cronon1991metropolis]())? Do these factor
into the story?
