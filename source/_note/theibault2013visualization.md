Quotes [staley2014visualization](/staley2014visualization/) (p. 9), who 
suggests a distinction between visualizations as "the organization of 
meaningful information in two- or three-dimensional spatial form intended to 
further a systematic inquiry" and images as a "supplement or illustration to a 
written account."

Theibault is interested in "visualizations as historical arguments . . . how 
do we deploy the visual capabilities of the computer to *show* what we wish to 
communicate?"

Suggests that "visualizations necessarily have a rhetorical dimension and 
that the principal challenge facing historians who wish to use visualizations 
in their work is to align the rhetoric with the audience's ability to follow 
it."

Nineteenth century political histories made use of conventional charts: maps, 
timelines, and dynastic charts. These charts were easier to read when 
describing the lineage of French royalty than describing the lineage in text.

The rise of social science in the nineteenth century and a new ability to work 
on large datasets led to new visualizations beyond maps, timelines, and 
genealogies. Yet "history was a consumer, not a designer, of most of these new 
visualizations---and mostly a sparing consumer at that, since economic and 
social history lagged behind political history as an area of research."

Notes the "innovative presentation" in Minard's Napoleon visualization. 
"Minard's chart is often cited as a model example of information visualization 
because it is easy to understand, even for people with little background 
information on the topic or quantitative skills. The challenge for 
visualization is to be transparent, accurate, and rich in information. 
Minard's information-rich visualizations set the standard for both 
transparency and accuracy in the kind of work that could be done before 
computerization."

The rise of cliometrics and the Annaliste in the 1960s led to a greater 
familiarity with quantitative methods. First wave social scientific history 
relied on statistical packages of SPSS and SAS to process large sets of data. 

"Instead of working as a driver of narrative, many of the tables and graphs 
produced in quantitative works of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s sat inert on the 
page, functioning more like the biographical pictures included in early 
historical works than as an integral part of the argument."

"The fact that the statistical tools deployed often embedded assumptions that 
were inapplicable to the messiness of actual historical processes lent a false 
aura of scientific precision to very tentative conclusions. Many explanations 
have been offered for the relative decline of social history since its heyday 
in the 1970s. A failure of imagination in the integration of visualizations 
with text-based arguments may have contributed to the decline."
