"massive military expenditures have spurred a major spatial shift in manufacturing production to the so-called defense perimeter. In this manner, the federal government, by means of its military budget and locational preferences, has promoted uneven regional development." (147)

"At the center of these processes of economic structuring and spatial shifts is the information sector, which includes both information technologies (the hardware part) and the use of advanced information systems (the software part). The spatial consequences of these information technologies and systems deserve more attention from historians than they have received. Introduction of these new technologies in the manufacturing and service sectors, for example, directly affects where businesses choose to locate -- since it reduces the need for spatial proximity." (147)

Olin sees Orange County as a leader in these processes -- economic restructuring, militarization of production, spatial transformation, information technologies and systems, internationalization of a regional economy. (148)
