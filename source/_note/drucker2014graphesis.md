p. 4: Not a history of visualization but "an outline of principles and precepts 
that structure visual forms of knowledge production and representation in 
graphic formats."

pp. 5--6: "The majority of information graphics, for instance, are shaped by 
the disciplines from which they have sprung: statistics, empirical sciences, 
and business. Can these graphic languages serve humanistic fields where 
interpretation, ambiguity, inference, and qualitative judgment take priority 
over quantitative statements and presentation of 'facts'?"

p. 6: Visualizations are always interpretations---data does not have an 
inherent visual form that merely gives rise to a graphic expression."

p. 9: "Most information visualizations are acts of interpretation masquerading 
as presentation. In other words, they are images that act as if they are just 
showing us *what is*, but in actuality, they are *arguments made in graphical 
form*."

p. 19: 

> Indigenous peoples map their territory in vastly different conventions than 
> western cultures, and with a different orientation to the globe itself. The 
> point? Images have a history, but so do concepts of vision and these are 
> embedded in the attitudes of their times and cultures as assumptions guiding 
> the production and use of images for scientific or humanistic knowledge.

p. 23: "humanistic visual knowledge was bracketed out of his [mathematician 
René Thom] account with particularly good reason: its methods threaten the 
very foundations of epistemological stability and mathematical certainty that 
align with empirical tenants."

p. 79: "The task of mapmaking requires a spatial imagination abstracted from 
direct observation or experience. In *Making Space*, John Rennie Short 
describes six distinct 'spatial discourses: the construction of the gird; 
emergence of cosmography; the mappings of the world; the navigation of the 
oceans; the survey of the land; and the annexing of the colonial territories.'"

p. 82: "Maps, like other graphic conventions, construct normative notions 
about time, space, and experience that become so familiar we take them for 
accurate representations rather than constructions. The constructed experience 
of space cannot be presented in standard cartography any more than the variable 
concepts of temporally can be charted on a standard timeline."

p. 89: "In the eighteenth century, the science of statistical analysis came 
into its own with unprecedented force."

p. 89: "The emergence of modern states and the bureaucratic administration for 
their management drives this development accompanied by the rapid increase of 
uses of the "Terms of *Number*, *Weight*, and *Measure*. The propose of this 
new approach was to abstract quantitative information from human conditions. 
All bar charts, line graphs, and scatterplots bear the imprint of that 
administrative agenda through the assumptions of their metrics naturalize in 
images."

p. 90: "René Descartes's seventeenth century work in analytical geometry 
established the mathematical basis for statistical graphs, for which 'the 
principle of coordinates and the idea of functionality' were 'sufficient.'"

p. 93: "Florence Nightingale's cockscomb formats were invented to catch 
attention, to grab the eye, and bring home the real circumstances of hospital 
conditions for the wounded in the American Civil War. They are presentational, 
rather than analytic. They area represented in the arcs is not proportional to 
the quantities they are supposed to represent. But they worked."

p. 94: "Flow charts appeared in the early twentieth century, apparently for 
the first time in the presentation done by efficiency expert Frank Gilbreth."

p. 97: "Tree diagrams contain the imprint of their allegorical origins by 
implying relations of hierarchy, categories, consanguity, derivation, and 
degrees of proximity."

p. 121: "Edmond Halley is credited with creating the first meteorological chart 
when he mapped the winds on the surface of the globe in 1686. His arrows of 
wind direction are not systematic, but they do indicate unstable, changeable 
conditions."

p. 125: Many visualization techniques were developed in disciplines separate 
from humanists. As such, "these graphical tools are a kind of intellectual 
Trojan horse, a vehicle through which assumptions about what constitutes 
information swarm with potent force."

p. 125: "Data pass themselves off as mere descriptions of a priori 
conditions."

p. 126: "humanists beginning to play at the intersection of statistics and 
graphics ought to take a detour through the substantial discussions of the 
sociology of knowledge and its critical discussion of realist models of data 
gathering."

p. 126: 

> Because realist approaches to data visualization assume transparency and 
> equivalence, as if the phenomenal world were self-evident and the 
> apprehension of it a mere mechanical task, they are <mark>fundamentally at 
> odds</mark> with approaches to humanities scholarship premised on 
> constructivist principles."

p. 127: "the task of representing ambiguity and uncertainty has to be 
distinguished from a second task---that of using ambiguity and uncertainty as 
the basis on which a representation is constructed."

p. 128: "the rendering of statistical information into graphical form gives it 
a simplicity and legibility that hides every aspect of the original 
interpretive framework on which the statistical data were constructed."

p. 128: "*Data are capta*, <mark>taken not given</mark>, constructed as an 
interpretation of the phenomenal world, not inherent in it."

p. 129: "By recognizing the always interpreted character of data we have 
shifted from data to capta, acknowledging the constructedness of the 
categories according to the uses and expectations for which they are put."

p. 129: The "more profound challenge we face is to accept the ambiguity of 
knowledge"

p. 130: "all information is *constructed*"

p. 131: "Capta is not an expression of idiosyncrasy, emotion, or individual 
quirks, but a systematic expression of information understood as constructed, 
as phenomena perceived according to principles of observer-dependent 
interpretation."

p. 135: Suggests a model for humanities' work:

  1. Modeling phenomenological experience in the making of humanities (*data* 
     as *capta*, primary modeling, the representation of temporal and spatial 
     experience);
  2. Modeling relations among humanities documents, i.e., discourse fields (a 
     different metric might be needed to understand dates on diplomatic 
     documents from the spring of 1944 or 1950);
  3. Modeling the representations of temporality and spatiality that are found 
     in humanities documents (narrative is the most obvious);
  4. Modeling the interpretation of any of the above (depicting or graphing 
     the performative quality of interpretation).
