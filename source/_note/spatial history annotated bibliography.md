**Akerman, James R. and Robert W. Karrow Jr. eds. *Maps: Finding Our Place in
the World*. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007.**

> This collection of Essays accompanied an exhibit at the Field Museum in
> Chicago and outlines the history of cartography while introducing the reader
> to the history of maps. With text and visuals, the authors show the changes
> and commonalities in how society has used and made maps over time. According
> to the contributors, maps are intrinsically linked to the time and place in
> which they were made-its social conventions, its political climate, and its
> society. The collection poses many questions for cartographers and spatial
> historians today, as well as great visual inspiration.

**Bailyn, Bernard, and Barbara DeWolfe. *Voyagers to the West: A Passage in
the Peopling of America on the Eve of the Revolution*. New York: Knopf,
1986.**

> Bernard Bailyn's Voyagers to the West (1986) won the author a second
> Pulitzer Prize while emphasizing an explicit spatial argument in an
> innovative Atlantic history perspective. On the very first page of Voyagers,
> Bailyn emphasizes the importance of the great quantitative shift in the
> number of immigrants arriving in the North American colonies at the same
> time that the geographical extent of settlement suffered a considerable
> expansion into the backcountry. The first chapter of the book is replete
> with detailed analytical maps (showing patterns of settlement, not just
> geographic accidents and "contextual" information) helping to underscore the
> importance of this shift in the spatial pattern of settlement and its
> attendant challenges to the British capacity for social control in the
> colonies. Bailyn goes on in the remainder of the book to trace out
> individual and collective destinies across the different spaces of the
> colonies–taking care, in this way, to use the comparative method to suss out
> the differences that geography made on spatial patterns of settlement and on
> late colonial society in broad terms.

**Baker, Alan R. H. *Geography and History: Bridging the Divide*. Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 2003.**

> Baker presents an exhaustive review of the scholarship that has emerged at
> the fertile intersection of the history and geography disciplines.
> Acknowledging the tensions that have existed in years past between
> historians and geographers, particularly where their research subjects
> overlap, Baker nevertheless argues for the interdependence of the two
> disciplines–that history cannot really be understood without incorporating
> geography, and vice-versa. This is perhaps obvious, in one sense, but
> historians and geographers do approach their work differently, creating
> challenges for historical geographers and historians embracing the spatial
> turn. However, the perspectives of history and geography ultimately
> complement each other, and Baker provides an engaging background in these
> perspectives and the prospects for continued explorations that bridge the
> divide.

**Bodenhamer, David J., John Corrigan, and Trevor M. Harris. *The Spatial
Humanities: GIS and the Future of Humanities Scholarship*. Indiana University
Press, 2010.**

> This is an edited volume of Essays by humanities scholars working with
> space. It deals mostly with theoretical topics rather than case studies, for
> example, "Turning Toward Place, Space, and Time" by Ed Ayers or "Qualitative
> GIS and Emergent Semantics" by John Corrigan. The editors hope that spatial
> humanities will "revitalize and redefine scholarship by (re)introducing
> geographic concepts of space to the humanities." The volume is a little
> GIS-centric (perhaps necessarily), but does a good job of getting at issues
> beyond just the discipline of history.

**Buisseret, David (ed.). *Envisioning the City: Six Studies in Urban
Cartography*. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998.**

> Throughout their existence, the layered complexities of cities have
> presented challenges to those who have sought to understand them. This
> volume presents examples of cartographic approaches to understanding the
> city and its future potential, ranging from ancient China, to Renaissance
> Europe, to Burnham's 1909 Plan of Chicago. What often emerges in these
> examples are idealized representations of the cities, subject to the desires
> of the map-makers and (especially) their patrons. These cartographic works,
> then, shed light on the cultural and social contexts that produced them in
> addition to the past urban forms represented.

**Carter, Paul. *The Road to Botany Bay: An Exploration of Landscape and
History*. University Of Chicago Press, 1987.**

> Paul Carter published The Road to Botany Bay as "an essay in spatial
> history," which outlines the historical process of space construction
> through place-naming in Australian history. Of particular interest is
> Chapter 1, in which Carter details how European explorers like Captain Cook
> used naming to order the land they "discovered" into a narrative of imperial
> exploration. Carter comes at it from a literary criticism approach, but it
> is useful for historians interested in more theoretical discussion of how
> place gets constructed.

**Cope, Meghan and Sarah Elwood, eds. *Qualitative GIS: A Mixed Methods
Approach*. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, 2009.**

> This slim volume is a collection of scholarly articles bookended by
> introductory and concluding chapters by the editors. Targeting new
> researchers, the stated aim of the book is "to frame the emerging field of
> qualitative GIS, profiling the range of ways in which researchers and
> practitioners are integrating GIS with qualitative research." While
> geographic information science technologies are quantitative tools, used to
> process, interpret, and represent data, Cope and Elwood make a case for the
> novel integration of these tools with qualitative skills, information, and
> research questions. The combination of techniques, they argue, requires
> ambitious and new methodologies that can deepen and shift our assumed
> conceptual frameworks and observations.

**Cronon, William. *Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West*. New
York: W.W. Norton, 1991.**

> William Cronon's Nature's Metropolis is a tour de force of environmental,
> economic, and cultural history framed by an explicitly spatial regional
> perspective. The object of analysis, Chicago, is defined by its region, the
> Great West, every bit as much as the growth of the city as a central place
> comes to define the American Midwest. Cronon draws upon venerable ideas from
> regional science in developing the argument of the book; in particular, the
> author deploys the concept of cities as central places derived from the work
> of Von Thünen. The book begins with transportation networks, observing both
> the contingent character of Chicago's rise (there were other possible
> centers) as well as illuminating what would come to be seen as decisive
> advantages. As networks of transport came to center on Chicago, so too did
> the growing city become the center of markets for goods such as grain,
> lumber, and meat. The spatial distribution of the production of these goods
> throughout the Great West provides the critical linkage between economic and
> environmental processes writ large and the specific configurations of
> markets and systems of processing and exchange that arose in the city of
> Chicago. In sum, Nature's Metropolis is remarkably successful in merging the
> analysis of spatial patterns, especially in terms of the city of Chicago and
> its far flung hinterland, with the production of space (via markets and
> technology) in temporal, that is, historical terms.

**Ethington, Philip J. "Placing the Past: 'Groundwork' for a Spatial Theory of
History." *Rethinking History*. 11 (2007), 465-494, 2007.**

> This essay, accompanied by several responses and critiques from other
> theorists, presents a dense but readable argument that time can only exist
> as a "place" in history. Ethington does a thorough review of basic theories
> of time and space, and critiques historians for paying too little attention
> to space - and, in fact, to time (as a concept). He argues that time, being
> often described using spatial metaphors (e.g. ahead, behind), is most
> effectively represented spatially (and therefore cartographically). His
> vision for a "vast multi-perspectival atlas of world history" is partially
> realized by the Hypercities project at UCLA.

**Fox, Jefferson, Ronald R. Rindfuss, Stephen J. Walsh, and Vinod Mishra eds.
*People and the Environment: Approaches for Linking Household and Community
Surveys to Remote Sensing and GIS*. Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers,
2003.**

> The studies presented in this volume highlight and advance the
> interdisciplinary work done to link the fields of remote sensing and GIS
> with the social sciences across multiple time and spatial scales. Looking at
> humans as "agents of landscape change that shape and are shaped by the
> landscape," these papers attempt to carve out new theoretical frameworks and
> practices to integrate quantitative data (e.g. remotely sensed data on land
> use and land cover change) and qualitative data (e.g. community mapping
> efforts or demographic surveys) into comprehensive, integrative stories.

**Fyfe, David A., Deryck W. Holdsworth and Chris Weaver. "Historical GIS and
Visualization: Insights From Three Hotel Guest Registers in Central
Pennsylvania, 1888-1897." *Social Science Computer Review*. Published online 8
April 2009.**

> Using a custom-developed visualization environment (dubbed "HotelViz"),
> these authors demonstrate the value of examining spatial and temporal
> patterns together in a single interface. Using their application, they
> combed through thousands of individual records from three hotels in 1880s
> and 1890s, discovering spatial patterns that reflected types of business
> travel, place hierarchy, and transportation corridors and temporal patterns
> that reflected the periodicity of weekly, monthly, or seasonal journeys.

**Hägerstrand, Torsten. "What about People in Regional Science?" *Papers of
the Regional Science Association* vol. 24, 1970, pp.7-21.**

> In addition to shifting the attention of geographers to a focus on the
> behavior of individuals, this seminal article is credited as one of the
> first to articulate a theory of "time geography." The central notion of this
> theory was that time and space are limited resources, and people behave
> according to these constraints to realize projects. Hagerstrand innovated
> the use of a visualization methods including space-time maps that allow one
> to plot an individuals path through time (with time as a third dimension)
> and space-time prisms that illustrate the opportunities and constraints of
> an individual in space and time.

**Harmon, Katherine. *You Are Here: Personal Geographies and Other Maps of the
Imagination*. New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 2004.**

> Harmon has collected hundreds of maps of real and imagined places to form a
> beautiful look at how cartography and spatial analysis add another dimension
> of how one views the world. Many of the maps are imaginary: maps of one's
> mind, of a memory, of fictional cities and places, of the path to heaven or
> hell. Others are more speculative, like maps of the American west before
> explorers crossed the continent. Harmon's book is a reminder that maps and
> cartography can be as insightful and beautiful as they are informative.

**Knowles, Anne K. *Placing History: How Maps, Spatial Data, and GIS Are
Changing Historical Scholarship*. Redlands, Cal.: ESRI Press, 2008.**

> Placing History is a collection of Essays that reflect on the value of GIS
> for research in history and historical geography. With contributions by some
> of the leading historians and geographers, the book capture the depth and
> breadth of the current thinking and practical use of GIS for history (in
> 2008). It reveals the variety of methodological approaches to using GIS in
> different disciplines, and the case studies presented provide readers a
> clear path to engage GIS in their own work. The book is accompanied by a
> CD-ROM that includes data, basic instructions on how to use GIS, and
> supplementary PowerPoint presentations from authors.

**MacEachren, Alan M. *Some Truth With Maps: A Primer on Symbolization &
Design*. Washington, D.C.: Association of American Geographers, 1994.**

> Written in part as a response to Mark Monmonier's popular and incisive How
> to Lie With Maps (1991), MacEachren seeks to distill best practices in
> geographic visualization for a growing audience of GIS users without formal
> cartographic training. The concepts and methods presented reduce the
> susceptibility to be unknowingly misled by on-screen displays of data. Of
> especial value are MacEachren's discussions of best practices for data
> exploration, and how to acknowledge, integrate, and symbolize uncertainty in
> geographic information. Even today the representation of uncertainty remains
> a thorny problem, lending continued relevance to this work.

**Mitchell, Timothy. *Rule of Experts: Egypt, Techno-Politics, Modernity*.
Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002.**

> In the vein of colonial and post-colonial studies, Timothy Mitchell uses
> space as a category of analysis in both senses of spatial history: space as
> a key variable in historical analysis; historical analysis as a critical
> element in describing the conceptual spaces of colonialism and modernity in
> Egypt. For instance, in Rule of Experts, Mitchell devotes the first chapter
> to an innovative exploration of the interplay between forces of modernity
> (dams, railroads, capitalist agriculture, wars) and the creation of a new
> spatial order in which the Anopheles gambiae mosquito moved into Egypt,
> caused an epidemic of malaria, and in so doing generated a whole new series
> of institutions and practices associated with vector control. In this way,
> Mitchell uses spatial patterns to help explain the unfolding of a particular
> historical episode and to draw together, under the rubric of spatial
> connections, the many disparate threads of the story of the mosquito in
> Egypt. He also points to the way historical data, read from a certain point
> of view, provide evidence for arguments about more universal themes, such as
> the space of capitalist modernity in colonial settings.

**Moellering, Harold. "The Potential Uses of a Computer Animated Film in the
Analysis of Geographical Patterns in Crashes." *Accident Analysis and
Prevention* (1976) 8: 215-227.**

> This pioneering work imagined the potential of revealing patterns in
> geographic data with animated displays long before developments in personal
> computers made such analyses practical for widespread use. Moellering's
> significant innovation was his manipulation of the temporal element of the
> data. When viewed with a conventional timeline, three years of traffic
> accidents in Detroit had little discernible pattern, leading one to believe
> the phenomenon was essentially random. Moellering provided a complementary
> view that combined the accidents into 15-minute time slices and arranged
> them into a "composite week," in which the frame for "11:15 am to 11:30 am,
> Tuesday," displayed all accidents that happened during that time of the week
> across the three-year dataset. Reorganizing the temporal data in this way
> revealed times of the day, and days of the week more susceptible to
> accidents, in addition to particularly troublesome locations in the network.

**Moretti, Franco. *Atlas of the European Novel 1800-1900*. London and New
York: Verso, 1999.**

> The Atlas of European Novel, 1800-1900 presents a unique and inspiring way
> of relating literature and geography. Through a series of simple, but
> information and idea-rich maps, Moretti describes the real and imagined
> places of individual novels and collections of novels. Ultimately, Moretti
> reveals the overlooked role of geography (both fictional and real) and ideas
> of geography (what is a boundary, periphery, spatial taboo, linear) on
> novels' narratives. He shows this convincingly both in general–how geography
> guides literary forms–and specifically–how plots self-organize and cohere
> around spaces and places. The book is a pleasurable and creative
> interleaving of prose, quotation, map, and caption.

**Mundy, Barbara E. "Mapping the Aztec Capital: The 1524 Nuremberg Map of
Tenochtitlan, Its Sources and Meanings." *Imago Mundi* 50 (1998): 11-33.**

> This is a wonderful article that analyzes a famous early modern map with an
> eye towards critical cartography. Mundy's subject is a 1524 map of
> Tenochtitlan, long one of the most recognizable maps of the early Spanish
> conquistador era in Mesoamerica. Instead of a European map, Mundy
> convincingly argues that the map was based on Aztec cartographic knowledge.
> Mundy's essay is, at its heart, an historical detective story that
> meticulously leads the reader through different indigenous elements of the
> map. Mundy reveals a cartographic skeleton of Aztec cosmology within the
> Tenochtitlan map. For example, by representing the city in a more uniform
> shape than its geographic reality, the map reflected a worldview that placed
> Tenochtitlan at its spiritual center. Like a lawyer amassing evidence for
> her case, Mundy carefully builds an argument that catapults indigenous
> cartographic knowledge to the forefront of the Tenochtitlan map.

**Rae, Douglas. *City: Urbanism and its End*. New Haven: Yale University
Press, 2003.**

> In this book, Douglas Rae explores the historical processes that gave rise
> to the "centered" industrial city and then, over time, dismantled that same
> space. The setting is New Haven, Connecticut, and the time period runs
> roughly from the late 1800s through the 1990s. Rae employs spatial analysis
> in several ways throughout the book. Notably, he geocodes the addresses of
> businessmen, workers, politicians, and members of the "civic fauna" and
> discovers patterns and trajectories of change.

**Reséndez, Andrés. *Changing National Identities at the Frontier: Texas and
New Mexico, 1800-1850*. Cambridge University Press, 2004.**

> Although not explicitly a work of spatial history, Andrés Reséndez's study
> of identity-formation incorporates strong themes of spatiality. He examines
> how people living at the border of Texas/New Mexico and Mexico during the
> early 19th century were faced with a range of choices in how to construct
> their national identity (Spanish, Mexican, American, Texan, Indian, etc.)
> within a geographical imagination. Reséndez also describes the incredibly
> fluid boundaries between different geographic entities at the time, along
> with how larger structural forces (particularly the Mexican state and the
> American market) impacted identity and spatial imagination.

**Schulten, Susan. "The Cartography of Slavery and the Authority of
Statistics." *Civil War History*, vol. 56 no. 1, March 2010.**

> Abraham Lincoln reportedly studied for hours a map of the slave population
> in the American south. The U.S. Coast Survey map collected 1860 census data
> into an effective heat map of the southern states. In this article, Schulten
> explains the significance of this map and others like it, as the map was one
> of the earliest instances of the graphic display of census data. Schulten
> argues that the maps were essentially nationalistic propaganda for the
> Union, as it justified the difference between the north and the south in a
> scientific, statistical medium. She goes on to detail other ways in which
> maps, charts, and the visual display of statistics helped shape American
> politics and thought.

**Self, Robert O. *American Babylon: Race and the Struggle for Postwar
Oakland*. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2003.**

> Self traces "the overdevelopment of suburbs and the underdevelopment of
> cities" from the 1940s through the 1970s, using California's East Bay as his
> case study. The book works on two levels. First, as a history of political
> culture in the postwar period, it looks at the struggle of African Americans
> for rights and power, as well as at the politics of suburban city building.
> Second, and more importantly for this bibliography, it is a "history of
> space," treating the ways space is carved up by ownership ("space as
> property"), by metaphorical meanings ("space as social imagination"), and by
> governmental entities ("space as political scale"). Self ultimately brings
> these two levels together, showing how radical Black political movements
> such as the Black Panthers, and conservative white movements such as
> Proposition 13, had roots that can be mapped onto the same metropolitan
> space.

**Sonlit, Rebecca. *Infinite City: A San Francisco Atlas*. Berkeley:
University of California Press, 2010.**

> In a series of maps accompanied by short Essays, Solnit and ten other
> writers describe particular experiences of San Francisco's past and present.
> Most use a familiar base map, oriented north-south with major roads and
> landmarks. But the places mapped are unexpected: the "lost world" of South
> of Market, 1960, before redevelopment; the "Third Street phantom coast"
> showing the current and former bay shoreline from China Basin to Candlestick
> Point, including former Chinese fishing villages, Butchertown, bygone
> breweries and race tracks; "Shipyards and Sounds" showing African American
> nightclubs and workplaces since World War II. This book seems more like
> homage than model, but the maps and text work together to show that where
> history took place matters as much as when it took place.

**Thomas, William G. and Edward L. Ayers. "The Differences Slavery Made: A
Close Analysis of Two American Communities." *American Historical Review*
108:3, 2003, pp. 1299-1307.**

> The Valley of the Shadow Project, created by Edward Ayres and William
> Thomas, is a pioneering digital history focused on the histories of two
> communities in the Shenandoah Valley, one in Pennsylvania and the other in
> Virginia, around the time of the Civil War. Particularly significant, with
> respect to Ayers and Thomas's project, is the fact that it appeared in
> print, in the American Historical Review, as well as online in an
> interactive digital archive maintained by the University of Virginia's
> Center for Digital History. (An Overview: The Differences Slavery Made: A
> Close Analysis of Two American Communities, AHR 108:3, 2003, pp. 1299-1307)
> The online portion included maps created with GIS software portraying
> important environmental, demographic, social and economic patterns in the
> two communities. By placing the Augusta and Franklin counties side-by-side,
> the Valley of the Shadow project used GIS to put forward an argument about
> the fundamental commonalities found in these two communities divided by the
> institution of slavery. Clearly, the argument about the common patterns of
> life, except for slavery was substantially strengthened with the addition of
> detailed spatial information: seeing these patterns, with one's own eyes in
> the carefully constructed pairings of maps provided by the authors, provides
> the kind of empirical confirmation that text alone would struggle to
> achieve. (The online version of the AHR article is located at:
> http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/xslt/servlet/XSLTServlet?xml=/xml_docs/ahr the
> digital archive of the Valley of the Shadow project can be accessed at:

**Tobler, W. and S. Wineburg. "A Cappadocian Speculation." *Nature* 231: 39-41
(May 7, 1971).**

> This is an interesting work that sought to deduce lost archeological town
> sites from scant evidence. Tobler and Wineburg built a network from the
> paired mentions of town names on cuneiform tablets, reasoning that towns
> mentioned more often should have larger populations, and that towns
> mentioned together more often are closer to each other. These two key
> assumptions, derived from the gravity model, comprise the logic of the
> resulting network of speculative town sites. Though the work did not succeed
> in pinning down exact locations for these sites (the authors suggest the
> average error in their calculations to be roughly 50km), it's a daring and
> innovative spatial analysis of archeological source data.

**Tufte, Edward R. *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*. Second
Ed. Cheshire, Conn.: Graphics Press, 2007.**

> The Visual Display of Quantitative Information details the importance of
> visualization in understanding and interpreting statistical data. Tufte book
> discusses many disciplines, but highlights several historical and map-based
> graphics as among the best statistical graphics ever drawn. Among them is
> Charles Joseph Minard's six-variable 1869 map of the fate of Napoleon's army
> in Russia. Tufte's book provides great inspiration for visualizations, and
> provides a theoretical explanation for what makes good visualizations
> usable, and bad visualizations difficult to read.

**Wood, Denis. *Everything Sings: Maps for a Narrative Atlas*. Los Angeles:
Siglio, 2010.**

> Wood is the author of a pioneering work in "new cartography," The Power of
> Maps (1992), Making Maps: A Visual Guide to GIS (2005, 2011), and several
> other influential works in cartography.
>
> This book however is a very personal set of maps of the author's home
> neighborhood in Raleigh, made with the assistance of students in the School
> of Design at NC State University over a thirty-year period. These include a
> map of Jack O' Lanterns, paths of buses, postal carriers, and paperboys and
> street trees by size. All are based on-require-personal observation of
> essential but fleeting experience. Wood argues the sum of such observations
> is the essence of his neighborhood.
>
> Ira Glass introduces the maps this way: "They describe human lives without
> ever showing us any people... Wood is writing a novel where we never meet
> the main characters, but their stuff is everywhere... Their lives seem far
> away and utterly present, both at the same time. Which somehow makes our
> world seem fragile and very precious. Maybe it is just me, but that seems
> like the opposite of the feeling ordinary maps give us, with their rock
> solid facts and their obsession with street names. They make the world seem
> anything but fragile."
