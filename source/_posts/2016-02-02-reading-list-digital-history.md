# Questions

- What is digital history? Should we be worried about defining digital history?
- Are there differences between digital humanities and digital history?
- Is history a "book discipline"? Should it remain one?
- What does digital history offer that you cannot do otherwise?
- What is the history of digital history?
- Where is the field of digital history headed? Where should it be headed?
- How does the history of digital history connect to the history of the discipline?
- What does digital history mean for your dissertation and other research?
- Let's say you're hired to teach at a small liberal arts college. How would you define digital history for them? What kind of challenges would you face vs. a larger institution, and how would you overcome them?
