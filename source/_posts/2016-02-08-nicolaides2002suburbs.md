## Synopsis

Becky Nicolaides examines the working-class Los Angeles suburb of South Gate 
between 1920 and 1960, describing the transition from "rough-and-tumble" 
community for new migrants who treated their home as a place for production 
and income. After the war, the community reoriented as it expanded its 
economic prosperity. This reorientation also introduced racialized white 
homeownership focusing on the protection of communities from intruding 
non-white people.

Prior to World War II, South Gate "stood midway between farm and city" divided 
among middle-class merchants and working-class laborers. The ability for 
the working class to enjoy mobility, leisure, work, and consumption led to a 
fragmented community. Working class people embraced the New Deal, but did so 
opportunistically to justify discriminatory housing policies to protect their 
economic gains. Postwar, conservatism intensified as the working-class enjoyed 
greater prosperity. The conservatism of the working class shifted their view 
of home and property from a place of production to a place of identity. The 
ideology served to erase class divisions among merchants and working-class, 
while divisions instead formed around race. Nicolaides lays bare how the working 
class could be pro-union in the workplace but conservative at home and 
neighborhood. By the 1950s, South Gate leaned on racial politics to resist 
integration and fuel a white suburban conservatism.
