## Welcome

My name is [Jason Heppler](http://jasonheppler.org) and I am a digital historian in the Department of History at Stanford University. You can get in touch with me at `jason@jasonheppler.org`. This is my open research notebook which contains notes of my ongoing research projects. The best places to start are:

- [Recent activity](/archive/): listing the most recent additions to the notebook
- [All pages](/archive-alphabetical/): see all pages in the notebook alphabetically

Also, check out the project tabs along the lefthand side. I also maintain [GitHub repositories](http://github.com/hepplerj) for other work related to my research and scholarship.

### Active Projects

- [Machines in the Valley](/machines-valley-manuscript/). This is my dissertation and soon-to-be book manuscript based on a rewrite of my dissertation. While I may not port over all of my notes into this new notebook, you can find traces of the work throughout.
- [Visualization in the Humanities](/visualization-humanities/). I'm collecting research on ways historians have used visualization in their work in order to inform my own thinking about visualization and narrative in digital history.
