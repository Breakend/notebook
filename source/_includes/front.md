## Welcome

My name is [Jason Heppler](http://jasonheppler.org) and I am a digital historian in the Department of History at Stanford University. You can get in touch with me at `jason@jasonheppler.org`. This is my open research notebook which contains notes of my ongoing research projects. The best places to start are:

- [Recent activity](/archive/): listing the most recent additions to the notebook
- [All pages](/archive-alphabetical/): see all pages in the notebook alphabetically

Also, check out the project tabs along the lefthand side. You can follow [my Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/hepplerj/items) for recent items, and I also maintain [GitHub repositories](http://github.com/hepplerj) for other work related to my research and scholarship.
