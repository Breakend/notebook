## Project Description

In what ways can historians take advantage of visualization techniques in the presentation and communication of historical arguments? Can we, through data-drive and visualization-driven research, shape new methods of revealing ambiguity, complexity, and exploration of the past?

My notes and research into visualization in the humanities feeds several areas of current work:

- A book chapter on evidence visualization in history (in progress)
- A potential course on data visualization in history (planning)
- A journal article on visualizing evidence in history (in progress)
- My larger professional interest in digital history and new methods of knowledge production

### Analyzing the AHR

I want to know what sorts of visualizations (charts, figures, graphs, maps,
tables) historians use in their publications. To visualize the visualizations, as it were. A sensible place to start is by looking at the entire run of the AHR. 

- [s] Download the run of AHR articles
- [ ] Devise an R script to extract images from PDFs, which should also record a data table of author, title, and date.

Talked to Lincoln about the idea; interested in collaborating.

Started downloading articles using a JSTOR -> Zotero workflow, and using Zotfiles to push PDFs to a separate folder. I'm only grabbing articles; not "Documents" or "Book Reviews." In 1915, "Notes and Suggestions" are introduced, I'm continuing to ignore these.

AHR Forum introduced in June 1978 (vol 83 no 3).

### Companion to Digital History

I'm under contract with Wiley Blackwell for the *Companion to Digital History* edited by David Staley. I'm authoring a piece on historical approaches to data visualization.
