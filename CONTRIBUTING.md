## Expected behavior

<!--
  Describe the intended output or what you expected to see.
-->

## Steps to reproduce the behavior

<!--
  Include a link to a public repository or ZIP file so that they can more easily be reproduced. Being able to see your actual files helps troubleshooting as most issues stem from missing YAML Front Matter, a mis-configured `_config.sys` file, or `_posts` content. 

  Describe the steps you took for this problem to exist. Such as you cloned the theme, customized `config.toml`, added your own posts, and started up a Hugo server locally.

  If an error occurred on GitHub Pages when pushing, please build locally and provide a complete log and including this output in the filed issue.

  Screenshots can also be included if they help illustrate a behavior.
