## Welcome

My name is [Jason Heppler](http://jasonheppler.org) and I am a digital historian in the Department of History at Stanford University. You can get in touch with me at `jason@jasonheppler.org`.

This is my open research notebook which contains notes of my ongoing research projects. The best places to start are:

- [Recent activity](): listing the most recent updates to the notebook
- [All pages](): see all pages in the notebook alphabetically

I also maintain [GitHub repositories](http://github.com/hepplerj) for other work related to my research and scholarship.

### Active Projects

- [Machines in the Valley](). This is my dissertation and soon-to-be book manuscript based on a rewrite of my dissertation. While I may not port over all of my notes into this new notebook, you can find traces of the work throughout.
