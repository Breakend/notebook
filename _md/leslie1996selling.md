p. 435: "If anyone deserved to be called 'the father of Silicon Valley,' it was
Frederick Terman. . . . it was Terman who first envisioned Silicon Valley's
unique partnership of academia and industry and trained the first generation of
students who made it happen."

p. 437: Frederick Terman explained to conference participants in Colorado that
"universities are rapidly developing into more than mere places of learning.
They are becoming major economic influences in the nation's industrial life,
affecting the location of industry, population growth, and the character of
communities. Universities are in brief a natural resource just as are raw
materials, transportation, climate, etc."

p. 437: Various places attempted to replicate Silicon Valley -- New Jersey,
Michigan, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Tennessee, South Carolina, Texas, South Korea
-- in the mid-1960s. Texas, South Korea, and New Jersey secured the consulting
services of Terman to learn about how to succeed as the next Valley.

p. 438: There are three things Terman did not understand in selling his vision of the
Valley: 1) overestimating the importance of an educational institution and
underestimating the difficulty of convincing competing firms to support common
goals; 2) failed to recognize the pattern of defense spending that Stanford
benefitted from; 3) did not appreciate the difference between the corporate
needs and strategies of start-ups in the Valley versus spatially-distributed and
vertically integrated multinational corporations that sought his advice.

pp. 437-438: Terman recognized the ability of research universities driving economic growth
as a graduate student at MIT in the 1920s and witnessed the cooperative
education programs sponsored by General Electric, AT&T, and other high tech
firms. In the 1930s, he helped remake Stanford's electrical engineering
development following MIT's pattern, cooperating closely with local firms
working in high tech. By the end of the decade, Terman had built
a nationally-recognized graduate program in electronics and supported student
entreprenuers including Hewlett, Packard, and Charles Litton.

p. 438: The demand of wartime electronics propelled tech companies in the Bay
Area. HP, a company of nine employees and $34,000 in sales in 1940 jumped to 100
employees and $1 million in sales in a single year. Terman helped direct wartime
funding to high technology firms. When he returned to Stanford in 1946, Terman
was convinced that industry "must develop its own intellectual resources of
science and technology, for industrial activity that depends on imported brains
and second-hand ideas cannot hope to be more than a vassal that pays tribute to
its overlords, and is permannetly condemned to an inferior competitive
position."

p. 438-440: Terman called this a campaign of "steeple building." Instead of
competing with firms and universities, Terman encouraged industrial growth in
areas where northern California had gained a niche. That guiding principle led
Stanford to establish a traveling-wave tube research program, support Stanford
alumni Varian brothers in founding their microwave tube company in 1948,
encouraged faculty consulting, arranged for industrial researchers to teach
courses, and established an honors program that allowed corporate employees to
earn degrees while working.

pp. 441-442: By the 1960s one-third of the country's traveling-wave tube
manufacturing and a large share of microwave tube manufacturing was located in
Santa Clara Valley. Several companies got their start at Stanford and drew upon
graduates and professors -- Hewlett-Packard, Varian Associates, Watkins-Johnson,
Microwave Electronics Corporation, Litton, Granger Associates, Huggins
Laboratories, and Applied Technologies. Other companies, although not part of
the Stanford lands, established firms near the campus to tap into the
entreprenural and corporate culture of the Valley. General Electric, Sylvania,
Admiral, and Zenith set up labs near the Park.
